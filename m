As we don't have a specific driver (compatible string) for it and if we
need to add that I think the term '*-audsys' is very suitable here, but
unfortunately, it has already picked for clock driver (see child node).

I also took ../../marvell/*-system-controller.txt as examples for my
case. Thus, I'm not sure should we still need a new one here?

No, we don't need reg property here, as the two sub-drivers will obtain
the regmap  which is propagated from the parent.
