Hi Mark,

I think the datasheet of buck/ldo could provide information about power
capability of each mode. The driver should adjust regulator mode per its
device's power requirement.

Below are some actual scenarios we have now. I provide them for your
reference. If unfortunately below cases are not the actual users you
ask, please kindly let me know more about your suggestion.
Thank you. :)

case 1:

We have a USB typeC micro-controller, which has two modes - standby and
normal. It requires 1.8V and 3.3V to operate (both powers are always
on). The device stays in standby mode when there is no cable in. When
cable in, we got an interrupt and change device into normal mode.

The standby mode power consumption is quite small, so we would like the
change mode of regulator into STANDBY to save more power. And we change
into NORMAL when we receive cable-in interrupt.

case 2:

About buck regulator for CPU, it usually provides PWM mode, PWM/PFM Auto
mode, PFM mode. I think it could map to FAST, NORMAL, IDLE mode
respectively. Most of time we would use just normal mode. However, we
would change regulator into PWM mode time to time to test buck output
performance on the tested board.
