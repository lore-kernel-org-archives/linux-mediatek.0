Oh, so these aren't things that Lee just applied but rather things that
have propagated through?  You didn't say what commits you were talking
about, you linked to a long gitweb URL that would have been difficult to
paste due to wrapping.  This sort of thing is why it's really helpful to
make your e-mails directly human readable, saying something like "these
depend on change X which is in Linus' tree now" would've made this
clear.
