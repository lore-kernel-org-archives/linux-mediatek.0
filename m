I think the device hierarchy for AUDSYS has to be depicted more
appropriately at first before we keep going to discuss the topic.


          ------- clock-controller
	  -
AUDSYS ---------- audio-controller 
	  -
	  ------- other controllers not being modeled yet

Currently, AUDSYS just works as a container containing all the devices 
present within the range reserved for audio relevant function and even
partial registers and bits for these devices are mixing within some of
the range. And for clock controller, they're just all being used to
provide to the audio-controller or other functional devices under AUDSYS
internally.

Thus, deferral actually happens between siblings, rather than between
parent and child. For example, the probe deferral Ryder said is pointing
to that audio-controller needs to wait until all resources like clock
resources all in ready state.

I'm not fully sure MFD can be used properly to describe such kind of
device hierarchy, but it's really worth having a good way to describe
the composition of hardware blocks precisely in device tree and to ease
extension device support under AUDSYS for future.


There is also the same thing happened in MMSYS as [1] stated.
