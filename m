Hi Rob,

Thank you for your comments.

For this part, we would like to revise as following:

alloc-range: required for dynamic allocation. The range must between
0x40000000 and 0x100000000 due to the co-processor's addressing
limitation

size: required for dynamic allocation. The unit is bytes.
for Face Detection Unit, you need 518KB.

FD driver might be able to use the FD memory pool inside the scp
reserved memory instead of declaring reserved memory here.
would you have any suggestion if so?

Sincerely,
