Some devices are designed and manufactured with some components having
multiple drop-in replacement options. These components are often
connected to the mainboard via ribbon cables, having the same signals
and pin assignments across all options. These may include the display
panel and touchscreen on laptops and tablets, and the trackpad on
laptops. Sometimes which component option is used in a particular device
can be detected by some firmware provided identifier, other times that
information is not available, and the kernel has to try to probe each
device.

This change attempts to make the "probe each device" case cleaner. The
current approach is to have all options added and enabled in the device
tree. The kernel would then bind each device and run each driver's probe
function. This works, but has been broken before due to the introduction
of asynchronous probing, causing multiple instances requesting "shared"
resources, such as pinmuxes, GPIO pins, interrupt lines, at the same
time, with only one instance succeeding. Work arounds for these include
moving the pinmux to the parent I2C controller, using GPIO hogs or
pinmux settings to keep the GPIO pins in some fixed configuration, and
requesting the interrupt line very late. Such configurations can be seen
on the MT8183 Krane Chromebook tablets, and the Qualcomm sc8280xp-based
Lenovo Thinkpad 13S.

Instead of this delicate dance between drivers and device tree quirks,
this change introduces a simple I2C component probe function. For a
given class of devices on the same I2C bus, it will go through all of
them, doing a simple I2C read transfer and see which one of them responds.
It will then enable the device that responds.

This requires some minor modifications in the existing device tree. The
status for all the device nodes for the component options must be set
to "fail-needs-probe". This makes it clear that some mechanism is
needed to enable one of them, and also prevents the prober and device
drivers running at the same time.

Changes since v9:
- Picked up review-bys
- Added inclusion of stddef.h for NULL

Changes since v8:
- Added missing include of <linux/kconfig.h> to i2c-of-prober.h
- Expanded description of i2c_of_probe_ops::enable to mention that
  returning -EPROBE_DEFER is valid (Doug)
- Reworded descrption of i2c_of_probe_ops::cleanup_early to avoid
  confusion with i2c_of_probe_ops::enable (Doug)
- Reworked i2c_of_probe_get_i2c_node() to return NULL on failure,
  matching most functions that return |struct device_node *|.

Changes since v7:
- Dropped log level of "enabling component" to debug
- Dropped file name from header file
- Reverted to __free() cleanup for i2c bus node
- Corrected "failed-needs-probe" to "fail-needs-probe" in commit message
- Fixed incorrectly positioned period ('.') in commit message
- Expanded description of i2c_of_probe_component()
- Expanded comment explaining check for "available" devices to note that
  if such a device is found then the i2c probe function becomes a no-op
- Simplified check for "available" devices for-each loop
- Expanded description of @free_resources_early callback to explicitly
  state that it is not called if no working components are found
- Dropped !cfg check
- Replaced "fail" with "fail-needs-probe" in i2c_of_probe_component()
  kernel doc
- Combined callbacks (.get_resources with .enable; .cleanup with
  .free_resources_late); .free_resources_early renamed to .cleanup_early

Changes since v6:
- Correctly replaced for_each_child_of_node_scoped() with
  for_each_child_of_node_with_prefix()
- Added namespace for exported symbol
- Made the probe function a framework with hooks
- Split out a new header file
- Added MAINTAINERS entry
- Reworded kernel-doc
- Dropped usage of __free from i2c_of_probe_component() since error
  path cleanup is needed anyway

Changes since v5:
- Fixed indent in Makefile
- Split regulator and GPIO TODO items
- Reversed final conditional in i2c_of_probe_enable_node()

Changes since v4:
- Split code into helper functions
- Use scoped helpers and __free() to reduce error path

Changes since v3:
- Complete kernel-doc
- Return different error if I2C controller is disabled
- Expand comment to explain assumptions and constraints
- Split for-loop finding target node and operations on target node
- Add missing i2c_put_adapter()
- Move prober code to separate file

Rob also asked why there was a limitation of "exactly one touchscreen
will be enabled across the whole tree".

The use case this prober currently targets is a component on consumer
electronics (tablet or laptop) being swapped out due to cost or supply
reasons. Designs with multiple components of the same type are pretty
rare. The way the next patch is written also assumes this for efficiency
reasons.

Changes since v2:
- New patch split out from "of: Introduce hardware prober driver"
- Addressed Rob's comments
  - Move i2c prober to i2c subsystem
  - Use of_node_is_available() to check if node is enabled.
  - Use OF changeset API to update status property
- Addressed Andy's comments
  - Probe function now accepts "struct device *dev" instead to reduce
    line length and dereferences
  - Move "ret = 0" to just before for_each_child_of_node(i2c_node, node)
