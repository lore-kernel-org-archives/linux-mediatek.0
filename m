I do believe that the issue I'm seeing on MT8192 is very similar to the 
issue described on MT8183. On my MT8192 Hayato, I get the following 
sync_state warnings due to these two display components not having 
drivers which bind to them:

   [   25.828186] mtk-power-controller 10006000.syscon:power-controller: 
sync_state() pending due to 1400d000.postmask
   [   25.838380] mtk-power-controller 10006000.syscon:power-controller: 
sync_state() pending due to 1400e000.dither

This device boots just fine up until I reach the point where my display 
manager starts, where I get a full SoC hang. If I disable my display 
manager from starting at boot, the device boots to a shell just fine. 
While MT8192 doesn't have ACP to prefetch anything from the GPU, the 
display manager (which uses 3D accel) still appears to trigger an AXI 
stall (I don't know how to verify this is actually what happens, but it 
seems likely) and I would assume the bootloader also leaves the MFG 
domains partially enabled on MT8192 based on this behavior.

The audio issues I see on MT8183 and MT8186 also seem to have the same 
root cause, the bootloader leaving domains partially enabled. On my 
MT8183 krane I get these warnings:

   [   21.705672] mtk-power-controller 10006000.syscon:power-controller: 
sync_state() pending due to 14005000.dma-controller
   [   21.705677] mtk-power-controller 10006000.syscon:power-controller: 
sync_state() pending due to 14006000.mdp3-wdma
   [   21.705688] mtk-power-controller 10006000.syscon:power-controller: 
sync_state() pending due to 14012000.dither

And I get this error when attempting to play audio:

   [  217.282793] mt8183-audio 11220000.audio-controller:mt8183-afe-pcm: 
mtk_afe_pcm_pointer hw_ptr err

In both the MT8192 GPU case and the MT8183/8186 audio case, the issue 
was fixed with the following diff to not use the sync_state system to 
keep domains powered on:

diff --git a/drivers/pmdomain/mediatek/mtk-pm-domains.c

  	if (MTK_SCPD_CAPS(pd, MTK_SCPD_ACTIVE_WAKEUP))
  		pd->genpd.flags |= GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP;

What isn't clear to me is why leaving display domains powered on is 
preventing audio from working. Maybe there is some dependency that isn't 
clear to me? The other thing which isn't clear to me is why I never 
experienced the boot hang on MT8183. Either way, I'm experiencing issues 
on multiple SoCs which are fixed by allowing the domains to power off 
and back on.
