No, this is just the PCB/controller limitation. But there are chips with
frequency limitations depending on the type of command (see for instance
Winbond AC timings tables for DDR capable devices).

Number of retry modes, how to enable retry mode (which is maybe
standardized per manufacturer, in this case we can just get the right
hook from the manufacturer information, but otherwise if there are
differences inside production lines from a single manufacturer, we'll
still need either a table or some extension of CASN.

Randomizer and ECC engine are two different things, there are many raw
NAND controllers with a programmable ECC engine *and* randomizer. They
just choose to hide the controls.

Today it is SkyHigh. What about tomorrow?

You claim you want to replace the ID tables. These tables are filled
with all the relevant data to make the chips supported in Linux. If one
of these fields is missing from CASN, it means we need to keep the
tables. So it kind of defeats the CASN purpose. Yes we may have dynamic
vendor hooks to adapt these parameters "on the fly", but we still need
internal tables for that.
