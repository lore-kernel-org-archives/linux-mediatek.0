You are referring whole series?
Citing the cover letter:
"MMSYS in Mediatek SoCs has some registers to control clock gates (which is
used in the clk driver) and some registers to set the routing and enable
the differnet (sic!) blocks of the display subsystem.

Up to now both drivers, clock and drm are probed with the same device tree
compatible. But only the first driver get probed, which in effect breaks
graphics on mt8173 and mt2701.

This patch uses a platform device registration in the DRM driver, which
will trigger the probe of the corresponding clock driver. It was tested on the
bananapi-r2 and the Acer R13 Chromebook."

DT is broken right now, because two drivers rely on the same node, which gets
consumed just once. The new DT introduced does not break anything because it is
only used for boards that: "[..] are not available to the general public
(mt2712e) or only have the mmsys clock driver part implemented (mt6797)."

Anyway, I'll send a new version which uses the platform device in the DRM driver
for all SoCs.

Matthias
