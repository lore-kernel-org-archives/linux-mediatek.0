Well, that's a problem.  A struct acpi_device should not be a parent
of anything other than a struct acpi_device.

So be it.

I see.

But why is the new symlink needed in the first place?  If the device
has a parent, it will appear under that parent in /sys/devices/, won't
it?

Currently, all of the thermal class devices appear under
/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/ because they have no parents and they
all get a class parent kobject under /sys/devices/virtual/, as that's
what get_device_parent() does.

If they have real parents, they will appear under those parents, so
why will the parents need to be pointed to additionally?

BTW, this means that the layout of /sys/devices/ will change when
thermal devices get real parents.  I'm not sure if this is a problem,
but certainly something to note.

The driver core is irrelevant here.

As I said before, a struct acpi_device object should not be a parent
of anything other than a struct acpi_device object.  Those things are
not devices and they cannot be used for representing PM dependencies,
for example.

So it should not happen there.

The PCI device should be its parent.

If you want parents, this needs to be done first, but I'm still not
sure what the parent of a thermal zone would represent.

In the ACPI case it is kind of easy - it would be the (platform)
device corresponding to a given ThermalZone object in the ACPI
namespace - but it only has a practical meaning if that device has a
specific parent.  For example, if the corresponding ThermalZone object
is present in the \_SB scope, the presence of the thermal zone parent
won't provide any additional information.

Unfortunately, the language in the specification isn't particularly
helpful here: "Thermal zone objects should appear in the namespace
under the portion of the system that comprises the thermal zone. For
example, a thermal zone that is isolated to a docking station should
be defined within the scope of the docking station device."  To me
"the portion of the system" is not too meaningful unless it is just
one device without children.  That's why _TZD has been added AFAICS.

I did and I think that you want the parent to be a device somehow
associated with the thermal zone, but how exactly?  What should that
be in the Wifi driver case, the PCI device or something else?

And what if the thermal zone affects multiple devices?  Which of them
(if any) would be its parent?  And would it be consistent with the
ACPI case described above?

All of that needs consideration IMV.
