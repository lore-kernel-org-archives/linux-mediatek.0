Changes since v1:
Continue the upstream journey based on the previous John Crispin's good work.
- add fixes for the v1 suggestion
- fix typo in the commit log
- add missing pinctrl bindings for mt7623
- reuse pinctrl driver for mt7623
- enhance existing nodes since the way for binding is changed e.g USB
- add more nodes which already gets support from the latest tree e.g MT7530 DSA
- add the dts file for Bananapi R2 (BPI-R2) board

This series extends the dts files used for booting mt7623 base boards.
Since support for mt7623 was added around v4.6, many new drivers have
been accepted upstream. The contained patches add several of these to
the devicetree.

Additionally the series does a bit of refactoring. Mediatek pointed out
that the evaluation board is infact a reference design and asked the the
evb files be renamed to rfb.

As with all of the current ARM bases MTK silicon, these boards also have
a PMIC. Instead of adding the nodes to all of the dts files, we add an
intermediate dtsi file that contains the required nodes. This allows us
to reduce the size of the top most dts files.

The RFB comes in various versions and asiarf has even done a crowdfunder
to sell them. We should try to reduce the duplication. This series adds
a common dtsi file for these boards. This results in the topmost dts files
only needing to specify the compatible string, MTD nodes and ethernet setup.
