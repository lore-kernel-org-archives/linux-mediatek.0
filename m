Hi

It seems we have 3 different kinds of cpu enable method now, and
mt65xx-smp doesn't cover all mt65xx series. So maybe it make sense to
change naming before it got merged.

Short summary for these methods:

mt65xx-smp:    	For mt65xx socs which wakeup all cores at boot.
		Tested on mt6589 by Matthias.
mt6580-smp:     Only first core is alive at boot, so need to wakeup
		other cores using SPM. AFAIK only for mt6580 now.
mt81xx-tz-smp:  For soc which wakeup all cores at boot, and have
		trustzone firmware. Suitable for mt8127, mt8135.

I'm not sure about smp for mt6592, maybe Howard or Scott can comment on
it.

Any suggestion on how we should organize these methods?
