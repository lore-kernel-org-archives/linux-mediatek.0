You should probably be listing the same interrupt number twice if 2
interrupts are combined.

To repeat, do not use extcon binding for new bindings. It is poorly
designed as it reflects extcon driver needs, not a description of the
hardware. If you have ID on GPIO, then that belongs in a usb-connector
node because that GPIO goes to the connector. For Vbus, you should
have a vbus-supply in the connector and use a gpio-regulator if it is
GPIO controlled.

I know what Vbus is. Unless Vbus is providing power to the host
controller, putting the Vbus supply in the controller node is not a
accurate representation of the hardware.
