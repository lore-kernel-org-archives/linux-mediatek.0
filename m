Most mt67xx and their 81xx siblings are feeding arch timer from cpuxgpt tim=
ers.
These are usually turned on by the firmware at EL3, so in general you can
disable both apxgpt and syst in the devicetree (unless 8167 feeds arch time=
r
from the gpt6 like 65xx...)

Have you tried to add {clk,regulator,pd}_ignore_unused? If that doesn't hel=
p,
try turning off cpufreq. On mt6595 I had to mark CPU regulator as always-on
(although it should be safe to disable) to avoid system freeze at the boot.
Otherwise start adding status =3D "disabled" to the devicetree nodes until =
it
properly boots.

Best regards,
Roman
