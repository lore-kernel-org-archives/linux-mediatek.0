In this instance, it doesn't seem like the parent pointer is null, since
it does print a parent clock name. I think the problem really is that the
parent gets disabled before the CLK_IS_CRITICAL check re-enables it.

The issue both SoCs seem to run into is that the parent gets disabled
when it shouldn't be, which I fixed in [1]. I don't think any platform
that already worked before this change will stop working with this fix
and the fix for the fix in [1], because if the parent is absent, then
the enable/disables are no-ops anyway. NULL clocks are explicitly
handled by the common clock framework.

The justification got lost in the revisions of the series this was done
in. It's to deal with the MediaTek MT8196's MFGPLL clocks, where the
parent clock needs to be on before the clock registers of the child
clock can be touched in any way. I first modeled this as an RPM clock,
but Angelo didn't like this approach, and with some hackery I could sort
of see that the child clock indeed does not tick if the would-be RPM clock
is off, so it must be a parent clock instead.

The problem with making it a parent clock and adding this flag to it though
is that the flag is not respected in recalc_rate, so it reads from an
unclocked register.

If you want me to make it an RPM clock instead, I can do that, but then
we're leaking that the NXP i.MX8MP has a broken clock driver into the
device tree bindings of the MediaTek MT8196 PLLs, which seems like a hard
sell for the DT bindings maintainers.

So in conclusion, I'm fairly confident I've found a fix for the fix, and
I'm also very confident the problem doesn't go as deep as you fear. I'll
squash the fix for the fix into the fix when I resubmit the fix with a
fix for the i.MX, but that'll have to wait until after -rc1 I think.

Kind regards,
Nicolas Frattaroli
