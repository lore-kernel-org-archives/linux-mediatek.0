So the exporter (you mentioned System heap) will somehow know how to
interact with the TEE subsystem to allocate suitable memory?

I suppose the memory could be from a static carveout, dynamic restricted
memory allocation, or how to turn normal memory into restricted memory
(fire-walling), depending on the platform.

Good point, this approach should make it easier for userspace.
