At first, I tried to split Makefile per directory,
and add header-test-y one by one.

I think you expect they look like this:


include/Makefile:

subdir-y += drm
subdir-y += linux
subdir-y += media


include/drm/Makefile:

header-test-y += drm_cache.h
header-test-y += drm_file.h
header-test-y += drm_util.h
...


include/linux/Makefile:

header-test-y += io.h
header-test-y += list.h
header-test-y += kernel.h
header-test-y += types.h
...



This is a straightforward way,
but I see some disadvantages.

Currently, there are more than 4000 headers
under include/.

So, to cover (almost) all of them, we must
list out 4000 entries.

When somebody adds a new header,
he will be very likely to forget to add
header-test-y for it.
So, newly added headers will always
fall off the coverage.


So, I am trying to take an opposite approach.

Add all headers in include/ by wildcard, then
filter-out one that cannot be self-contained.

In my analysis, 70% of headers are already conf-contained.
After some fixups, 95% of headers can become self-contained.

At this moment, the wildcard only covers some directories
or patterns, but my plan is to extend the wildcard gradually.


Please feel free to suggest alternative ideas.
