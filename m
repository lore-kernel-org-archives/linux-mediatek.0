At the moment, you have something like this:

	sysirq: intpol-controller@10200620 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6755-sysirq",
			     "mediatek,mt6577-sysirq";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		reg = <0 0x10200620 0 0x20>;
	};

I suggest that, when you have a second base (which is effectively
another controller), you add:

	sysirq2: intpol-controller@10201620 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6755-sysirq",
			     "mediatek,mt6577-sysirq";
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		irq-base = <32>;
		reg = <0 0x10201620 0 0x20>;
	};

Where irq-base is the first SPI this is connected to (the lack of
property indicates implies that irq-base is 0). This becomes a very
simple change in the driver.

I'd rather fix the driver and the binding to do the right thing once and
for all. In my experience, you will need to add a third base in six
months, and a fourth soon after. I'd rather either support an arbitrary
number of bases, or a single one per controller (and have multiple
controllers).

Thanks,
