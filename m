Does this happen? I thought the interrupt would only be delivered once
all drivers have resumed from the noirq resume phase. Maybe the SPI
controller needs to resume there instead of in the normal resume path
and then this isn't a problem.

I prefer we teach the genirq layer about these types of irqchips. That
way the solution is common and not a one-off fix for Mediatek chips. I'm
sure that this same problem will come up again for another SoC vendor
out there so having a chip flag that does the other half of
IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND would be appropriate.
