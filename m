Hi Sean,

Thanks for offering to help out. I've added Matthias' other email address
to Cc here, let's see if he notices the discussion now. Ideally any
important platform should have multiple maintainers so there is
always a backup person when the primary contact is unavailable
for any reason.

I'm not sure how much we can still do for 4.12, if you can prepare a
branch now we can definitely have a look and see what we can
realistically take for a late merge, but as we are in the second half
of the merge window already, we would normally put new features
into a 4.13 branch and only take bug fixes for 4.12. If there are
some entirely new files for additional boards, or only small changes
to the existing files, we might make an exception this time.

Don't worry about that at the moment, if Matthias cannot be reached
at all, we have to find an alternative way to get patches in.
