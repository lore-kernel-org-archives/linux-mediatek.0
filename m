Did mediatek license the IP block from someone else or was it
developed in-house? Is there a name and/or version identifier
for the block itself other than identifying it as the one in mt7623?

Please be more specific about what each interrupt is for, and how
many there are.

This seems odd: you have a device that is simply identified as "pci"
without any more specific ID, but you require additional properties
(clocks, reset, ...) that are not part of the standard PCI binding.

Can you clarify how the port devices related to the root device in
this hardware design?

Have you considered moving the nonstandard properties into the host
bridge node and having that device deal with setting up the links
to the other drivers? That way we could use the regular pcie
port driver for the children.

I think the name should not include the number of the port but rather
be always the same here.
