If a clock is used inside the ccf driver, its tree should be modeled ac=
cording=20
to the hardware - including these external clocks. Somebody (at least s=
ome=20
chip designer or so) should know where these clocks actually come from =
;-) .

You are right that not all clocks needs to be implemented in a ccf _dri=
ver_,=20
but as the devicetree binding describes the hardware and is supposed to=
 be=20
stable and (nearly) unchangeable outside-connections of the clock block=
 need=20
to be defined carefully.

In general I think everything that has a connection to the outside (ext=
ernal=20
source clock and clocks used by soc ips) should be modeled precisely. W=
hat=20
then happens inside the clock controller is less important, as it norma=
lly can=20
be fixed later on too.


Citing my own code [which got inspired on how Samsung did this], Rockch=
ip=20
clock controllers also have numerous possible external clock inputs wit=
h only=20
the 24MHz oscillator being required [0].

All the other clocks may or may not be present. For example xin32k norm=
ally=20
comes from an i2c-connected rtc or pmic chip which gets probed a lot la=
ter in=20
the boot process, so we rely on the orphan-handling of the ccf for thes=
e.


So please really try to find out what these clocks are in the first pla=
ce ...=20
somebody must know this ;-)
