In my opinion, they are just the provider-consumer relationship not the
parent-child relationship, and we leverage this mechanism for most CCF
users.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  

That's why I sent the a new one to separate them (but I forgot to modify
mt2701-afe-pcm.txt).

I've look at some display drivers, but couldn't find a good case. The
different is, that the driver I saw provides clocks to other submodules,
while the AFE is just a user. So it's odd if we register AFE itself as a
clock provider (and use the clocks it generates).
