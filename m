The panel being a separate device means that it needs a compatible
value and the compatible value implies a specific video timing. It
would be redundant, therefore, to repeat the video timing in the
panel's device tree node that already has the compatible string.

Two things: you can define a separate .dtsi file with the panel
definition with the current approach, too. But it would be a waste to do
so because really the only thing you need to change is the compatible
string.

The approach chosen in the DTS that you link to below might seem like a
simpler way, but it completely ignores aspects other than timings. What
if the panel requires a GPIO and or regulator to turn on. How are you
going to represent the power up sequence for that in DT? This was
attempted a long time ago and deemed too complicated to do in DT, hence
why we ended up with what we have now.

There are also panels on more complicated busses, such as DSI. These
panels often require additional register programming, so in addition to
the above you'd need some sort of register programming table in DT for
these to work.

That's not an upstream tree, so it isn't relevant to this discussion.
The decision to make the panel a separate device and put the video
timings into the driver was made a couple of years ago and we're not
going to change that. It's fine if you want to disagree, but I'm afraid
it won't change things.
