Hi Dan,
Mike is working on a new CCF feature called "coordinated clock rate changes"
which would help to migrate mt8173-cpufreq driver to generic cpufreq-dt
driver, and I am working with him to port MT8173 clock driver on the new
feature. So I think that's why this patch was not picked since it will
be migrated to new implementation once the new feature's ready.

@Mike:
Are you plannig to post those patches on the mailing list ?
Or is it fine for you to take this first and then I will refine it for
the new feature later?

Best Regards,
Pi-Cheng
