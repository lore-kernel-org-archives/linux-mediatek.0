The PCI core interface (pci_scan_root_bus_bridge()) starts with
sysdata in the struct pci_host_bridge, so every PCI bus under that
host bridge has the same sysdata.  

You have multiple root ports (sounds like two ports in this case)
under that host bridge.  Each port has independent interrupt mappings,
but the MMIO address space routed to the ports is described in the
upper-level host bridge (the "pcie" node in DT).  I assume the I/O and
MMIO routing through the root ports works as described in the
PCI-to-PCI bridge spec, using PCI_MEMORY_BASE, PCI_PREF_MEMORY_BASE,
etc.

If that's the case, I think your current DT "pcie" node is
appropriate, and both ports should have the same sysdata (as they do
in your current patch), and you do need some additional way to get
from that sysdata (the struct mtk_pcie) to the per-port data (the
struct mtk_pcie_port).

Apparently the two root ports of this MT7622/MT2712 controller are
hardwired at device (PCI_SLOT) 0 and 1.  Using a list to look that up
seems like a little overkill, since you could index an array by
PCI_SLOT(), but I guess you could do it either way.

I would probably rename "port->index" to "port->slot" or similar to
make it more obvious that it's not merely the Nth port we found; it's
the one that is hardwired at PCI_SLOT N.

Also, s/mtk_pcie_parse_ports/mtk_pcie_parse_port/, since it parses one
port each time you call it.

And factor out the lookup as Ryder suggested so it's not duplicated in
the mtk_pcie_config_read()/mtk_pcie_config_write() paths.
