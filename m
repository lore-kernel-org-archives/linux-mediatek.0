We used to avoid the pop sound from user space by closing hw path from outside to inside.
The control here is just to avoid the state is leaved in muted state.
I'll take a look at the mute_stream() though.

this IRQ num is not shared with other module, it's only for audio.
We error handle by clearing the all the irq status again, when
interrupts is sent but status not matched. we consider this handled?

I'm concerned if returing IRQ_NONE, will i no longer be able
to receive irq from this irq line?
Thanks
