On that, I agree. That's a miss.

Sorry Krzysztof, but now I really think that you don't understand the basics of
MediaTek SoCs and how they're split in hardware - and I'm sorry again, but to me
it really looks like that you're not even trying to understand it.

> The objection was about DUPLICATING interfaces or nodes.

I don't see that duplication. The interface to each clock controller for each
of the hardware subdomains of each controller is scattered all around the (broken
by hardware and by concept, if you missed that in the discussion) HW Voter MMIO.

There are multiple clock controllers in the hardware.
Each of those has its own interface to the HWV.

And there are some that require you to write to both its HWV interface and to the
clock controller specific MMIO at the same time for the same operation. I explained
that in the big discussion that Laura linked.

"especially the mux-gate clocks can't really be put in one single clock controller
because to manage those we have to write to the HWV *and* to the clock controller
MMIO"

Clarifying that, "the clock controller" -> "each clock controller of each hardware
subdomain" (not a single clock controller, excuse my bad wording).
