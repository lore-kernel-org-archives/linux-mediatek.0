I use device link between the smi-larb device and the iommu-consumer
device. Take a example, smi-larb1 have 4 VDEC ports. From 4/13 in this
patchset, we use device_link to link the VDEC device and the smi-larb1
device in the function(mtk_iommu_config). since there are 4 ports, it
will call device_link_add 4 times.

If the iommu-consume device(like VDEC above) is removed, It should enter
device_links_driver_cleanup which only ref_put one time. I guess whole
the link should be removed at that time.
