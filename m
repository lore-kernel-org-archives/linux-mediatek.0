When I tried doing this it did not work. The first issue is that 
mt7530_setup_mdio() uses a static int and increments it to make its ID. 
And normally this would create higher numbered busses but still work, 
however from what I remember there's something (not mt7530) that 
searches for mt7530-0 anyway and is unable to find it. I don't remember 
now what was doing it but I remember thinking I would need a global ID 
generator with reuse of released IDs.


Furthermore, I think I'd have to test all of the PHYs that are 
downstream of this switch because this is the first time we would 
actually be asking them actually register and unregister multiple times 
each startup, so if there are bugs, then they're kinda my bugs.


So if this is a requirement, then I think this patchset will need to go 
on the back burner and that support would probably be its own 
patch/patchset. So please let me know how you're feeling on this because 
I don't want to put too much time into the rest of this patchset if it 
is going to have to get shelved for a while anyway.


Thanks,

Caleb
