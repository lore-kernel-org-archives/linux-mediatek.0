If this ever happens it is really unfortunate and needs fixing, too. If
you need the power domain to be powered ON to properly read or even
change the clock registers, the clock driver needs to be a consumer of
the power domain, so any clock operations powers the domain up.

I would still say this is the correct solution. If the vencsys clock
registers are itself clocked by VENC_SEL this driver needs to make sure
this clock is running at the appropriate times. I understand that this
may be a bit of an overhead, but clock enable/disable paths are not
really performance critical.

I can't really argue with this being the wrong solution if we already
have precedent of the same solution being used for other domains. But I
would still ask you to re-evaluate with the above in mind.

I tend to agree. DT backwards compatibility isn't easily done (and is a
constant burden, as it gets harder to test over time) and if the SoC is
in early bringup one might just admit that the first iteration of the
bindings were wrong and need an incompatible change.

But that's not up to me to decide, but something Matthias needs to make
a decision on.

Lucas
