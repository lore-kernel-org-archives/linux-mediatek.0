Sorry not explain in pull request mail. Third pull request remove two
patches:

1. arm64: dts: mt8173: Add subsystem clock controller device nodes
   I think this should pull by Matthias, so I suggest James remove this
patch.

2. clk: mediatek: Export CPU mux clocks for CPU frequency control
   Mike said this patch is ok before
(http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-August/364886.html) 
But he told Pi-cheng recently he is working on coordinate clock rate, he
suggest Pi-cheng change this patch, other patches are ok. So James
remove this patch.

Eddie
Thanks
