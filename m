Ok, got it. Generally, we should try to avoid using the earlier initcall
levels, but a few things like clock controllers, iommus etc are special
enough that we need to make sure their dependencies are there by the
time those are probed.

Please put your explanation above into the patch changelog and add a code
comment about the IOMMU next to the subsys_initcall() so it doesn't
accidentally get changed when someone tries to do a code cleanup.
