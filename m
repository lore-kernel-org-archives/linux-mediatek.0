This patchset adds support SMP on MediaTek MT6580 Cortex-A7 quad-core SoC.

This is based on v4.2-rc1 and following patch series:
(1) Yingjoe Chen's "Add SMP bringup support for mt65xx socs" [1]
(2) Mars Cheng's "Add mt6580 basic chip support" [2]
(3) Sascha Hauer's "Mediatek SCPSYS power domain support" [3]

The secondary cores are power off as default on MT6580, this change adds
a new enable-method to turn on power to the cores during booting process.

The System Power Manager (SPM) inside the SCPSYS is for the CPU MTCMOS
power domain control. Please check [3] for more information about SCPSYS.

Change in v4:
1. Remove boot_lock and pen_release stuff
2. Fix some coding style

Change in v3:
1. Add CPU power control in SCPSYS driver

Change in v2:
1. Rebase to 4.2-rc1
2. Fix using usleep() in atomic context
3. Put a timeout in cpu power on/off sequence
4. Fix some coding style
