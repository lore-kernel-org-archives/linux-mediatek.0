net: wwan: t9xx: Add control plane transaction layer

This commit adds the core control plane structures (struct mtk_ctrl_blk
and struct mtk_ctrl_trans) and the mtk_ctrl_init()/mtk_ctrl_exit() entry
points for the T9XX WWAN driver. The DMA engine and TX/RX service
implementations are left to later patches.

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but at this point in the series nothing calls
mtk_ctrl_init() or mtk_ctrl_exit(). That means:

- mdev->ctrl_blk in struct mtk_md_dev is never filled in.
- Nothing creates a struct mtk_ctrl_trans.
- Nothing in pcie/mtk_pci.c uses the newly added include:

    #include "mtk_trans_ctrl.h"

The subject says "Add control plane transaction layer", but this patch
only adds structures and helpers that nothing can reach yet.

The next commit, "net: wwan: t9xx: Add control DMA interface", adds the
callers:

    mtk_pci_probe()->mtk_pci_dev_init()->mtk_trans_ctrl_init()->mtk_ctrl_init()
    mtk_pci_remove()->mtk_pci_dev_exit()->mtk_trans_ctrl_exit()->mtk_ctrl_exit()

Could these helpers and the include move into the patch that adds their
callers? Otherwise, could the subject say that this patch only adds the
scaffolding?

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but mtk_ctrl_init() allocates ctrl_blk with
devm_kzalloc(), and mtk_ctrl_exit() only clears mdev->ctrl_blk. Suppose
init and exit ran more than once while the device stayed bound. Each
mtk_ctrl_init() call would add another devres allocation and overwrite
mdev->ctrl_blk without freeing the old block.

That can't happen at the end of the series. The only path to
mtk_ctrl_init() is mtk_pci_probe()->mtk_pci_dev_init()->
mtk_trans_ctrl_init(). mtk_ctrl_exit() is reached only from
mtk_pci_remove() or the probe error path. Devres then frees the block at
unbind, as the kerneldoc says.

By the end of the series, mtk_ctrl_exit() also calls
mtk_fsm_notifier_unregister() and mtk_port_mngr_exit(). So the teardown
hook does end up in place.

Would it help to add a comment saying mtk_ctrl_init() may only run once
per bind? That would keep a future reset path from calling it again.

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but nothing assigns ctrl_blk->trans in this patch.
The back-pointers in the new struct mtk_ctrl_trans in
pcie/mtk_trans_ctrl.h are never set either:

    struct mtk_ctrl_trans {
    	struct mtk_ctrl_blk *ctrl_blk;
    	struct mtk_md_dev *mdev;
    };

mtk_ctrl_plane.h is a generic header, but it names the pcie-only struct
mtk_ctrl_trans. It does not include or forward-declare the header that
defines it. The code still builds, because C allows a member that points
to an undeclared struct tag.

The next commit, "net: wwan: t9xx: Add control DMA interface", replaces
this member with void *ctrl_hw_priv. Later in the series,
mtk_trans_ctrl_init() sets trans->mdev and mtk_pcie_hif_init() sets
trans->ctrl_blk.

Could the ctrl_hw_priv member be added here directly? That would avoid
adding a trans member that is removed one patch later.
