Ok, I think speaking to Robin helped me a bit with this...

Ok, so redrawing your table from above, I think we can say something like:


CPU Physical address
====================

0G	1G	2G	3G	4G	5G
|---A---|---B---|---C---|---D---|---E---|
+--I/O--+------------Memory-------------+


IOMMU output physical address
=============================

				4G	5G	6G	7G	8G
				|---E---|---B---|---C---|---D---|
				+------------Memory-------------+


Do you agree? If so, what happens to region 'A' (the I/O region) in the
IOMMU output physical address space. Is it accessible?

Anyway, I think it's the job of the driver to convert between the two
address spaces, so that:

  - On ->map(), bit 32 of the CPU physical address is set before calling
    into the iopgtable code

  - The result from ->iova_to_phys() should be the result from the
    iopgtable code, but with the top bit cleared for addresses over
    5G.

This assumes that:

  1. We're ok setting bit 9 in the ptes mapping region 'E'.
  2. The IOMMU page-table walker uses CPU physical addresses

Are those true?

Thanks,

Will
