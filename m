No, that's wrong... and I really don't see why you're trying to make a
meal of this.

In both cases, it's the EDID as received from the device.  One subsystem
happens to represent it internally as a "struct edid" in its drivers,
another subsystem uses "unsigned char []".

In order to _cleanly_ accept both styles, without having to resort to
driver authors needing to litter their code with lots of idiotic casts,
I'm accepting a void * pointer, so that we can accept _both_ a struct
edid and an unsigned char array.

Both are compatible with each other.  Both have the same bytes at the
same offset.  There is no difference between them other than the C
types that are used by each subsystem.

That is one use, but if an audio driver wants to parse the raw EDID
instead of the ELD, it can.

What I want to avoid is having the video driver parse lots of different
bits from the EDID and then send lots of events "just in case" something
wants some of the parsed information - it's much more efficient to give
drivers the raw information and allow them to parse what they need from
the EDID.  I'm not convinced that parsing out the physical address, and
then passing that from the video side is a good idea.

The reason I made an exception for the ELD is because (a) it's already
passed between video and audio drivers, (b) the code we have present to
convert an EDID to ELD is in DRM, and requires DRM data structures
which won't be available in an audio driver.

If you want a mechanism to pass just the physical address, we could add
it, and require CEC drivers to make use of both the EDID or physical
address events.  That would mean situations where the physical address
is known to be fixed before hand can be easily catered for.
