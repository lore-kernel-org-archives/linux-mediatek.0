The codec driver is a dummy driver for bt device and actually do
nothing. The user-space will control both bt part and alsa part (at
least in mt2701 platform). Yes the sound/soc/codecs/bt-sco.c was only
support 8k and was already there before the patch, but I think it might
be ok to extend it to 16k without any side effect.

If you worry about some potential risk (I don't see any) maybe we have
to develop another dummy bt-sco codec driver which support both 8k and
16k?
