There are several problems you need to fix. First,
"mediatek,mt2701-audsys" is not documented. It is only used in the
example. Second, bindings/arm/mediatek/mediatek,audsys.txt should move
to bindings/sound/ if it is only audio related functions. Or perhaps
just combine the 2 documents because it is all inconsistent currently.

The 2 documents are inconsistent as to what is the relationship of
-audsys and -audio (afe) nodes. mt2701-afe-pcm.txt shows that the AFE
is already a child of -audsys. The -audsys node should have
#clock-cells. It should also not be a simple-mfd (another
inconsistency in the binding) because it needs to probe first to
provide clocks to child nodes, and then trigger probing the child
nodes.
