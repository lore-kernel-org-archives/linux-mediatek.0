Hi Manivannan,

it's nice to see that someone at Linaro cares about upstreaming the 96 board.
>From what I can see, your patches add the very same support to the board as
does the mt6797 evaluation board. Do you have plans to upstream more drivers for
the board? Do you have a roadmap or something?

I'm asking becuase I don't want to have just another dead devicetree in the
kernel which does nothing but provides a boot to rootfs. Especially as this can
be achieved on the same board with the EVB dts.

Regards,
Matthias
