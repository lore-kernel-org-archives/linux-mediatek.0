No, I haven't tested these patches. I'm just testing my out-of-tree 
driver on top of vanilla v5.4-rc1. I'm just mentioning the issue here as 
it seemed like a reasonably appropriate place.

However it looks like I will also need to test on top of these patches.

flash_lock -u errors for my driver on top of vanilla v5.4-rc1.

When I make the change, as above, flash_lock -u and -l succeed, but I 
can still write to the flash - I need to check that more - it may be my 
buggy driver.

IIRC, it did work for my driver based on v5.3

The flash is n25q128a11:
[   14.917868] spi-nor spi-PRP0001:00: n25q128a11 (16384 Kbytes)

As for the driver, it's another HiSilicon SPI NOR controller driver 
which I'm developing - I eluded to it here already:
