I am not sure.

I just converted the current mainline code to support phylink and  
mimic the DTS
of the SDK. But the SDK seems to be incorrect.

Realtek[0] calls these modes:
* SGMII (1.25GHz) Interface
* High SGMII (3.125GHz) Interface
Also the datasheet that I have doesn't talk about base-x modes.

But MT7622 Reference manual[1] page 1960 says:
  The core leverages the 1000Base-X PCS and Auto-Negotiation from IEEE 802.3
  specification (clause 36/37). This IP can support up to 3.125G baud  
for 2.5Gbps
  (proprietary 2500Base-X) data rate of MAC by overclocking.

So I think it phy-mode should be 2500Base-X in this case.

SGMII part is a bit hard for me to support, I don't have the hardware,
MediaTek datasheets are mostly incomplete and also I am a not familiar  
with it.

But I think I know what I have to change.
Based on your explanation above.

I think this more correct implementation:

* 1000base-x and 2500base-x always force the link.
* SGMII is always inband but I need in phylink_mac_link_status() to readout
   "PCS_SPEED_ABILITY Clause 45 3.5" register to see the inband status?
   Or is it just the GMAC PSMR register? For me it is a bit confusing.
   SGMII block has a register to set the link speed and etc. But tests on the
   bananapi R64 board shows that I also need to set the GMAC register else it
   didn't work. Also it is not easy to debug if you don't have the board.

No.
