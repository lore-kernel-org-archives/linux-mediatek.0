net: tcp: fix fraglist GRO flushing on alternating TCP PSH flag

This patch removes the unmasked TCP flag word comparison from the is_flist
branch of tcp_gro_receive(). Segments whose PSH/FIN flags differ from the
held packet can then be appended to a fraglist GRO skb. The goal is to stop
premature flushes when a sender alternates [ACK] and [PSH, ACK] segments
in forwarding and tethering setups.

> This redundant check causes premature flushing on any incoming PSH packet,
> shattering aggregation and increasing softirq overhead.

[Severity: Medium]
Is the removed check really redundant? Commit 8d95dc474f85 ("net: add code
for TCP fraglist GRO") added it to the is_flist branch on purpose.

The general path can mask FIN|PSH out of its first comparison only because
it later ORs those flags into the held packet's header:

    tcp_flag_word(th2) |= flags & (TCP_FLAG_FIN | TCP_FLAG_PSH);

The is_flist branch jumps to out_check_final before it reaches that line.
So the unmasked comparison was what kept every fraglist member's flags
identical to the head's.

The removal also relaxes FIN, not only PSH. Data-carrying FIN segments,
such as the last segment of a response, can now join a fraglist. The
commit message doesn't mention this.

The claim that push semantics are preserved seems to hold only when the
skb goes through skb_segment_list(). Could the commit message describe the
FIN change and the cases raised in the comments on the diff below?

[Severity: High]
Can this drop a forwarded FIN or PSH from the wire?

Without this check, skb_gro_receive_list() links an in-sequence [PSH, ACK]
or [FIN, ACK] data segment into the held skb's frag_list. The is_flist
branch then jumps to out_check_final. That skips the only place where
FIN/PSH reach the head header:

    tcp_flag_word(th2) |= flags & (TCP_FLAG_FIN | TCP_FLAG_PSH);

tcp4_gro_complete() and tcp6_gro_complete() return early for is_flist.
The head can't carry FIN/PSH itself, because out_check_final would have
flushed it. So the head header has neither flag, while the last frag_list
member has them.

tcp4_gso_segment() uses __tcp4_gso_segment_list() only when the geometry
still matches and SKB_GSO_DODGY is clear:

    if ((skb_pagelen(skb) - th->doff * 4 == skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_size) &&
        !(skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_type & SKB_GSO_DODGY))
        return __tcp4_gso_segment_list(skb, features);

Otherwise it falls back to tcp_gso_segment()->skb_segment(). That path
copies head_skb's headers, TCP flags included, into every segment.

tcp_gso_segment() then clears fin/psh on every segment except the last:

    while (skb->next) {
        th->fin = th->psh = 0;

The last segment keeps the head's flags, which never had FIN/PSH.
tcp6_gso_segment() has the same fallback.

These can trigger the fallback on forwarded traffic:

  bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6() and bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4(), reached through
  bpf_skb_change_proto() (for example CLAT/464xlat when tethering), set
  SKB_GSO_DODGY on GSO skbs.

  bpf_skb_net_grow() and bpf_skb_net_shrink() set SKB_GSO_DODGY.
  bpf_skb_net_grow() can also linearize frag_list skbs when
  BPF_F_ADJ_ROOM_FIXED_GSO is not set.

  Any pull or linearize that changes the geometry has the same effect,
  for example skb_ensure_writable(skb, skb->len) in NAT mangling.

In those cases the receiver doesn't get the FIN until the sender
retransmits it, and PSH is silently cleared.

A fraglist skb redirected to a local TCP socket after GRO (DNAT/TPROXY) is
also parsed from the head header only. TCP has nothing like UDP's
local-delivery fraglist handling, so the FIN would be missed there too.

ORing the tail's flags into th2 in the is_flist branch doesn't seem to fix
this. skb_segment_list() emits the head skb with its own TCP header, so the
first segment would then carry a spurious FIN/PSH.

[Severity: High]
Does this also hide the tail's FIN/PSH from netfilter, conntrack,
flowtable, tc and BPF? All of these read only the aggregate's head header
before segmentation.

In conntrack, get_conntrack_index() only checks the head's tcph->fin, so
the FIN transition never fires. tcp_in_window() computes:

    end = segment_seq_plus_len(seq, skb->len, dataoff, tcph);

skb->len covers all of the fraglist payload. The +1 for FIN is missing,
because tcph is the head header. The peer's ACK of the FIN then hits:

    if (!before(sack, receiver->td_end + 1))
        return nf_tcp_store_invalid(ct, sender, log, NFCT_TCP_INVALID,
                                    NF_TCP_LOG_ACK_OVER, receiver->td_end + 1);

That ACK is classified invalid, and so are the peer's own FIN and the
final ACK. A typical "ct state invalid drop" rule would then drop the
teardown packets. Without such a rule, the entry stays ESTABLISHED instead
of moving to FIN_WAIT/CLOSE_WAIT.

In the flowtable, nf_flow_state_check() reads fin/rst only from the head
header, so NF_FLOW_CLOSING is never set for the offloaded flow.

tcp_mt() in xt_tcpudp and the nft tcp flags match also read only the head
header, so a FORWARD rule that matches FIN or PSH won't fire.
skb_segment_list() copies only the MAC header from the head and keeps each
member's own TCP header. The FIN/PSH therefore still goes out on the wire
and bypasses that policy.

Before this patch, the unmasked comparison guaranteed that the head header
described every member of the fraglist.
