Yes, my initial thought is that I would like to embed drm platform
device into mmsys. It is the easiest way to solve problems caused by
compatible string conflict we met here in short term.

But for long-term goal, device has to define its own dt-binding before
the driver is being implemented. Currently, drm driver uses wrong
compatible string,  "mediatek,mt2701-mmsys" or "mediatek,mt8173-mmsys",
that are owned by mmsys device [1], not by drm device.

We can use embed a platform device into mmsys for solving issue caused
by the older device tree binding.

But for long-term, it's neccessary to have a drm device dt-binding
document allowing drm driver and its components driver to follow.
