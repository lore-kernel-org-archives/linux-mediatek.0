My main worry with this approach is that SoC/board bring-up tends to be
an iterative process in practice, and it usually starts with a
bunch of resources forcibly enabled (either in the bootloader
or directly in Linux) because that's easy. Problem is, that's also very
easy to forget defining non-optional resources when the dts[i] is
upstreamed, because everything seems to work just fine. And because of
this DT backward-compat constraint, if get it wrong, and the supply is
needed for real, when we get to implement the real thing we're just
screwed. Having a runtime error preventing the device to probe forces
people to at least think twice before doing something stupid, like
making the SRAM (or L2-cache) supply point to the core supply when they
are two distinct regulator outputs.

Regards,

Boris
