The SRAM size to be used is defined by params_buffer_bytes(params), not
fixed (of course limited by the actual available SRAM size on HW), so
the latency should be the same compared to a DRAM having the same size. 

The SRAM can be used by any memif, and that's why the plan was let DT
make the decision.
