Exactly that seems to be the problem we hit. I have to setup my chromebook to do
some changes, but that won't happen before the week after next week.

So yes, the MMSYS is the top-level-entry point for the display subsystem, the
clocks in mmsys are just a small part of the whole register block. I will cite
the cover letter which unfortunately wasn't send, because I broke my email setup:
"Possible solutions:
1) We add a new mediatek,mt8173-mmsys-clk node, which lives as a simple-mfd
under the actual mmsys node. We change the clock driver to probe on this
binding. This would make sense as the clock gate register live completely in
the MMSYS configuration registers.

2) As the nodes of the DRM subsystem just need some of the registers of MMSYS
we add a new binding mediatek,mt8173-dispsys which probes the central
component of the DRM system. It has only a handle to mt8173-mmsys to access
the registerspace via regmap functions."

So this patch set implemented solution 2).

They are all mapped somewhere at 140xxxxx. But there are other components which
are used by other HW blocks smi_common especially. So I'm not sure which impact
that move would have.

The MMSYS for mt8173 actually enables the overlays and set's the multiplexer for
the output path. Does this make sense? It's the first time I've a deeper look in
such a driver, so maybe I don't grasp everything.

Matthias
