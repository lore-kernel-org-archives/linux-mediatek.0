In fact the major change of this patch is trigger (set) CON0_PCW_CHG no
matter PLL is on or not.

On MT8173 for example, ARMPLL's enable bit can be controlled by other
HW. That means ARMPLL may be turned on even if we (CPU / SW) set
ARMPLL's enable bit as 0. In this case, SW may want and can still change
ARMPLL's rate by changing its pcw and postdiv settings. But without this
patch, new pcw setting will not be applied because its enable bit is 0.
