Yes, your guess is right. the DTS explicitly includes skeleton64.dtsi so
two memory node is being generated.

The address where memory is located at is fixed so I should insert a
patch removing skeleton64.dtsi before adding a unit address to each
memory node.

Furthermore, the original DTS including skeleton64.dtsi seems to be a
little improper as CPU uses 32-bit addressing way to access all hardware
devices on MT7623 SoC. Thus, it seems to be better even necessary to
explicitly set both #address-cells and #size-cells to 1 at the root node
and change reg property for following the child nodes when
skeleton64.dtsi is being removed.
