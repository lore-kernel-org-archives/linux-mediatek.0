You are right, it took far too long for me to respond with a new version of the
series. The problem I face is, that I use my mt8173 based chromebook for
testing. It needs some downstream patches and broke somewhere between my last
email and a few month ago. I wasn't able to get serial console to work, which
made things even more complicated. Anyway, long story short, I got sidetracked
with other stuff and didn't send a new version.

If you have time to work on this, I'd happy to see things being pushed forward
by you :)

After re-reading the emails I think the missing part is, to probe the clocks
from the DRM driver instead of adding a new devicetree binding for them.
