Hi Sudeep,

Sorry for late reply.

For sched_clock_register, please see
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mediatek/2015-July/001547.html
which was accepted in
https://git.linaro.org/people/daniel.lezcano/linux.git/shortlog/refs/heads/clockevents/4.4


You are right it is also used as clock event. I think we don't need to
mention those detail in commit message, so I'll change to just:

"Add device node to enable GPT timer."

Will do in next round.
