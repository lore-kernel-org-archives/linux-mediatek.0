No it's not requiring anything in the PHY node, instead it fishes for 
econet,en751221-chip-scu in the DT. I'm not much a fan of this pattern 
because of the magic, but this way of accessing is fairly common and in 
this case it is how Airoha likes to access the chip-scu thingy when they 
need it.

I tested my board removing the EEE disable and the MASTER line, and it 
seems to work. I can't get any CRC errors flooding the link, and 
MII_STAT1000 reads LPA_1000LOCALRXOK | LPA_1000REMRXOK | LPA_1000FULL 
which suggests to me that it's able to operate happily in slave mode.


So unless you or someone else thinks it's inadvisable, I'm inclined to 
just enable these things and then wait to see if anybody finds a board 
that has problems.


Thanks,

Caleb
