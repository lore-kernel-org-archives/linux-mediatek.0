Fair enough. But I am struggling to understand how this fits into
existing IRQ infrastructure. Few controllers that don't have wakeup
source configuration facility can set IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE and just
leave the interrupts enabled in suspend path to wake it up. So IMO,
the above strategy might not work on such controllers.

I agree that they are entirely different APIs, I am not sure if we can
support different interrupt controller with such strategy.

Since the irq/pm core handle disabling device IRQs and section "System
Wakeup Interrupts, enable_irq_wake() and disable_irq_wake()" in
Documentation/power/suspend-and-interrupts.txt gives me different
understanding, we can check with tglx on how to handle this.
