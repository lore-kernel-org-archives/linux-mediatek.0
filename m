The old crop API can't be used with most (all?) codec drivers. Codec drivers do
exactly the opposite of what the old crop API did.

It is the reason the selection API was created.

The old crop API was written for SDTV receivers where the hardware would crop
the received video. For output (rarely used) the hardware would compose the
image into a larger (PAL or NTSC sizes) frame.

Applications have to use the selection API to work with codec drivers. Just
ignore the old crop ioctls, they are not suitable for such hardware.

That doesn't help. Where in these two chains does the cropping (encoder) or
composing (decoder) take place? I assume it is the DMA engine that read from
a rectangle in the source buffer (encoder) or writes to a rectangle in the
destination buffer (decoder).

And in that case the current driver is correct.

I wonder if the g/s_crop description in the V4L2 Specification should get a
big fat warning that it doesn't apply to codec drivers and that the selection
API should be used instead. A patch for that is welcome!
