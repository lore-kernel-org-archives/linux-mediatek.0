I'm not saying we shouldn't support it, just that we can't support it wit=
h
the current code. And adding support for it will require a fair bit of
restructuring.

If a hardware block as multiple independent channels the best approach in=
 my
opinion is to register multiple components (Which we can't do at the mome=
nt,
because there can only be one component per device). From a framework poi=
nt
of view there is no difference between a single device with multiple
independent channels and multiple independent devices with one channel ea=
ch.
Both have the same logical topology.
