OK, I'll use tx-delay-ps instead of tx-delay.

The fine-tune circuit and coarse-tune circuit are parallel, and
fine-tuen is a select switch.
It depends on users to choose which circuit is take effect.
I shouldn't assume users would choose fine-tune when delay < 3200ps, and
coarse for > 3100ps.

so, tx-delay-ps will be chosen, and "fine-tune" boolean property should
be remained as a indicator.

OK, tx-delay-ps will be a meaningful property.
If more delay circuit is added, fine-tune property(boolean --> u32) can
still be a indicator.
