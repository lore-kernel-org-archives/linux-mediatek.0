Some of the register blocks like infracfg is a potpourri of different 
functions. Clocks and power domains are some of them. In the drivers 
this is isolated, but there are many blocks which are not used at the 
moment and therefor are not documented in bindings description (e.g. 
debug control for the very same block, not sure if that will be 
implemented one day).

Would it be ok for you, if James just lists the blocks which already 
have an implementation and leaving apart the rest of it?
