[top-posting to facilitate]

Gary, Angelo, what's the status here? It looks like this fell through
the cracks -- or was this issue fixed in between somehow? If yes: great!
If not: Would be good to finally resolve this, as we are long past "fix
within a week" rule of thumb from Linus:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/handling-regressions.html#on-how-quickly-regressions-should-be-fixed

And also nearing -rc6, which is when Linus would like to see all known
regressions fixed.

Ciao, Thorsten
