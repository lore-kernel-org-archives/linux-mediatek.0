No! You'd have to determine the failure threshold of the test and
apply some math to find a lower boundary of your RNG's entropy.

What the quality is for: your RNG produces bits, but not all of them
are completely independent of each other i.e. not completely random.
So you simply lower the quality rating to express the net entropy
contained in the data stream.
