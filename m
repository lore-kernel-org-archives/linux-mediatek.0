If it is as simple as that, i suggest you detect it at runtime.

In the driver structure, you provide a match_phy_device()
function. This get called independent of what ID value you have in the
structure. So you first need to check if the ID matches. Then check
the 1G capability.

Ideally you want the code in the same driver, because module loading
happens based on the ID. I'm not sure user space will load two drivers
if they both indicate the same ID. Something you can experiment with.

Consider adding comments as well. Also consider replacing the infinite
loop with a bounded loop, and return -EIO if the it goes around the
loop too many times. What you are trying to avoid is on hardware error
a CPU constantly spinning until power off.

Consider using phy_package_init_once() to configure the shared things
by the first PHY to probe, independent of what address it is.
