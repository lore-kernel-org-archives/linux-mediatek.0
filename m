For example the bfusb.c old driver does frame H:4 as well and then no extra state keeping for H:4 is needed. Just pass the frames up into the core via hci_recv_frame (or hci_recv_diag for vendor diagnostic) and move on with it.

Thanks for the explanation, I didn't show what the extra header is, that causes some misunderstanding.

The mtk extra header doesn't provide any idea where a frame ends and starts in the bluetooth stream. 

It is just totally a legacy stuff used by mtk combo devices sharing a serial transport, such as BT/GPS/FM running via a shared UART, to
let the host know what type of radio the following bytes is for and how long it's. 

The extra header is really useful for a combo device, splitting flow and fitting in a single serial transport, but for a single device such as
mt7622 Bluetooth I made here, it seems to be useless.

Because the extra header doesn't provide any details about this stream and each radio stack still needs to be in charge of their stream
parsing. That is why I still want to use recv_h4.h instead of coding my own parser.
