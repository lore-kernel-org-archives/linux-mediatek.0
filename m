Yeah I thought about that as well, but there's a fundamental issue with splitting
the thing in multiple patches...

For enabling the tvd_clk in a separate patch, there's no problem - however, for the
others....

1. We need to introduce support for MT8195/88 DPI-HDMI, or the other patches would
    not make sense (nor apply, anyway); then
2. We stop setting pixel clock with another patch; then
3. we don't power on/off, etc etc

The problem with doing it like so is that the patch #1 that I described would be
introducing *faulty code*, because the support for that really depends on all of
the others being present (otherwise the block won't work correctly).

So... if you want, I can easily split out the tvd_clk enable/disable, but splitting
the rest wouldn't be clean.

Besides, keep in mind that... actually... for anything else that is not MT8195/88
DPI0 (so, for other SoCs' DPI and for 95/88 DPINTF) the tvd_clk is already getting
enabled by its child.. so, for those ones, a call to enable tvd_clk does exactly
nothing apart from incrementing (enable) or decrementing (disable) the refcount for
this clock by 1.

This means that the enablement/disablement of tvd_clk is actually important only
for the MT8195/88 DPI and has literally no effect on anything else that is
currently supported by the mtk_dpi driver anyway.

Still - if you want me to split out the tvd_clk en/dis patch, just confirm and I
will split that one out...

It kinda is - the HDMI-TX block gets its clock from the HDMI PHY's clock gen,
but eventually it is the HDMI driver that tells to the PHY driver what clock it
actually wants.

For #1, clk_prepare_enable() is ungating the clock that would otherwise gate the
PHY's PLL output to the HDMI block.

Alright - the hardware reason is that the HDMIPHY generates the clock for the HDMI
TX block, and that enabling the clock assigned to tvd_clk is necessary to ungate
the PHY's ckgen output to the HDMI-TX (and I think - but not sure as I haven't
analyzed that yet - that HDMI-RX should have the same gating technique, but that's
definitely out of scope for this submission).

#4 is there both for a SW and for a HW reason.

The HW reason is that the DPI shall be powered on in a specific sequence in regard
to HDMI-TX, due to the setup that is required by both (and ungating clocks before
full configuration happens would lock up the hw block).

The SW reason is that mtk_crtc.c calls mtk_crtc_ddp_hw_init()->mtk_ddp_comp_start()
in its .atomic_enable() callback, which happens in the wrong sequence in regard to
HDMI because of the "natural" components order in the DRM framework (for MT8195/88!
because for the others it either is the inverse or it does not matter - so for
performance it's okay for it to be like that both on older SoCs and on DPINTF for
95/88) and this means that we *must not* call dpi_power_on() at that time but
we must rather follow the atomic_enable()/bridge_enable() order imposed by DRM
*also* for the clock en/dis calls in DPI.

Angelo
