Hi Jassi,

CMDQ driver doesn't know the task type, so CMDQ cannot decide which
tasks can be dropped. So, I think the answer is "no".

Client driver is also hard to emulate a circular buffer where oldest
task is overwritten by newest submission. Let me illustrate with DRM
client (display driver). For DRM, the only way to know the latest
mouse cursor task before vsync is vsync interrupt. However, if we
keep latest mouse cursor task and start to send it to CMDQ after
vsync, the task may be executed outside the vblank and generate garbage
on screen in this case. (since we allow nested interrupt) We can wait
one more vsync to prevent garbage, but we will lose mouse cursor
performance. Therefore, our current solution is to flush all DRM tasks
into CMDQ, and queue all tasks in GCE HW. When GCE get vsync event, it
can finish all tasks within vblank to fulfill DRM's requirement.

Back to our original statement, we need to flush all tasks to queue
in GCE HW; i.e. we need to use mbox_client_txdone after
mbox_send_message, or send tx_done once mailbox controller receive
message (task). However, we still need a way to notice done tasks to
clients. Currently, we don't have a good way to call callback in mailbox
framework. Therefore, CMDQ driver has its owner callback functions.

Thanks,
HS
