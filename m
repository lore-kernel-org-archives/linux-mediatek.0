Hi,

Since mt6323 was similar with mt6397, I think we can reuse the
mt6397_chip without duplicate code.

Maybe we can rename the local variable name to avoid confusing.

struct mt6397_chip *mt_pmic;
...
...
switch (id & 0xff) {
	case MT6323_CID_CODE:
		mt_pmic->int_con[0] = MT6323_INT_CON0;
		mt_pmic->int_con[1] = MT6323_INT_CON1;
...
...

Henry
