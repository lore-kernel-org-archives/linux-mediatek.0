Hi Dan,

Thanks for your comment.
This solution looks good to me.
I will change it as your suggestion.

But, I have a question about 'mask out the provided *device virtual*
address'.
Are lower 16-bits (or 24-bits for JUMP op) of device virtual address th=
e
same as device physical address?
If not, we still need to pass in physical address into CMDQ driver.

Thanks,
HS Liao
