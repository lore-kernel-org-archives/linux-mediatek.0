OK, I find it a bit confusing to have Mediatek bindings but no
compatible Mediatek SoCs.
But it is true that it can't be used stand-alone. I will remove this
reference and also remove it from the mtk.c driver code from this patch
serie.

Again I'm confused by the fact that it is the Mediatek bindings.
Hence why I have added it and why it was not present in the v1 that was
only for Globaltop.
I find it odd mentionning the chipset but not all its interfaces.
I will remove these sections and only list supported interfaces (i.e.
UART). Other interfaces can be added afterward if one finds a board that
provides them.

Thanks I will clean this section.
