So the proper setting should be:

clk_name,          parent,    rate
-------------------------------------
"clkph_mck_o",     "clk26m",  0
"usb_syspll_125m", "clk26m",  125 * MHZ
"dsi0_dig",        "clk26m",  0
"dsi1_dig",        "clk26m",  0
"lvds_pxl",        "lvdspll", 0
"lvds_cts",        "lvdspll", 0

usb_syspll_125m will keep in 125 MHz event in different products.Others
may be changed by DRAM or display settings.

Daniel, do you think it's OK to model these clocks like above?


Best regards,

James
