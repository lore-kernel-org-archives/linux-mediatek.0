You have received the same feedback at least twice now, from two
different maintainers, that the delay should be specified in pS, and
the driver should figure out what values to place into registers.

You should not ignore feedback like that. If you don't understand the
feedback, please ask us to explain it. If you don't agree with the
feedback, you need to argue why you think it is wrong, or why what you
are doing is better, etc.

We are here to help, but just ignoring us won't get you anywhere.

For the moment:

NACK
