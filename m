This is a kind of odd situation here. The fix from Adam is actually correct, as in,
the SN65DSI83 bridge gets broken without...

....but then, there's some more oddness going on: I tried to reproduce this on my
MT8173 Elm device, but there I can resume the system just fine, and the display is
up and running like normal?

I'm not sure what to advice here at this point - just adding some info.

Cheers,
Angelo
