It looks like it's an intermediate parent IRQ controller; that's quite a
common design for MFDs on slow buses to cut down on the number of status
registers to poll.  IIRC there at least used to be some framework reason
for not using normal chained interrupts for these but I can't remember
it any more - possibly something to do with threaded handlers.

This is all looking very famililar, I suspect it's based on other
drivers dating back years rather than doing anything original.  There's
certainly a bunch of other drivers with very similar patterns in tree,
this doesn't look like it's got any problems over what most similar
drivers are doing.  The patterns all predate drivers/irqchip and a lot
of them will come from me.

IIRC from when I wrote drivers for chips like this these operations are
called with interrupts disabled so you can't write to interrupt driven
buses so you need to cache the write and flush in sync_unlock().  You
can't do this with regmap as it stands since on a device that can't be
accessed with interrupts disabled you'd need to disable the writes
before going into the interrupts off section and there's a risk that
having the device cache disabled would disrupt some other function on
the chip that was expecting writes to get posted immediately. =20

It would be possible to add per-register cache only behaviour but
someone would need to do that and it's not clear that it's worth the
effort, especially since for slow buses we currently lock the entire
regmap including the cache with mutexes so you can't actually access the
cache with interrupts off at the minute.

IIRC it was done this way because it wasn't altogether clear if
operations on multiple interrupts could ever be batched or not and given
that we're dealing with slow buses the cost of the loop is negligable.

See above.

I think that's it but like I say I can't remember clearly any more, it's
been a decade.

IIRC it's due to it being the main interrupt for the device and there
being at some point issues with this getting propagated to parent
interrupts so wake just got turned on all the time for the parent and we
relied on controlling the children.  Making things be proper chained
interrupt controllers would solve that I think.
