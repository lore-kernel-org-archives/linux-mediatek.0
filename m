Sure, I can do it using C99 style comments at the first two lines.

In addition, I'm really curious where we can find a reference to the
rule and if it 's a strict rule for all the drivers.

Because I'm considering whether I should turn other driver into using
the same rule.

Yup, it can use KBUILD_MODNAME directly.

Sorry for I didn't answer the question in the short time.

After spending some time on a confirmation with design, it is
DMA_SLAVE_BUSWIDTH_4_BYTES and not be configurable.

After check again, these lines are all already aligned to 80 chars

I think I should get your points.

I guessed what you meant is that it should be returning 0 instead of
-ENOSPC for all successful descriptor issuing either in part or in full

I will refine this flow based on the thought.

next is not hardware value. it's maintained by software which is always
between 0 to MTK_DMA_SIZE - 1, and definitely doesn't get a bad value.

rxd is also definitely a good ref
