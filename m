It was not intended to be insulting and sarcastic. It was based on a
general observation from a whole raft of patch series that has led me
to the conclusion that cover messages are basically completely ignored.

Many times, I've posed questions in cover messages... and have _never_
got a response to those questions.

I'd even started experimenting putting stuff in the cover messages to
provoke some kind of a response... and got nothing.

I had got to the point of wondering why I'm bothering to write
expansive and detailed cover messages.

Everything was pointing towards cover messages being wholesale
ignored - and it was a complete waste of time writing them.

Having got to that point, to then get asked, basically, "why are you
including this patch" when I already said in the cover message for
the _RFC_ series (requesting comments - obviously not a submission)
that the 10th patch was preparatory for DSA, and would be included
along with a user when it's submitted - that all suggested to me
that, yet again, the cover message hadn't been read.

You've said that you do read them (thanks) but I think you're probably
the only one, and I still question their value given the lack of
engagement with cover messages.

This is a serious point. What use are cover messages on patch series
beyond providing an anchor to tie a patch series to and provide a
diffstat? Given my observations over the last year, I don't think
including very much else adds any value. Certainly not asking
pertinent questions. Certainly not describing the patches in the
series. Certainly not describing the overall rationale, nor
(apparently) the plan for the patches.

You may have noticed that I'm no longer putting as much effort into
cover messages - and this is precisely why. I honestly don't see
that there's any point in spending much time on cover messages anymore.
