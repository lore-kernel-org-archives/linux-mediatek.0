Maybe you think that MT8183 SoC only has the I3C controllers. Actually,
there are I2C and I3C controllers on MT8183 SoC. We will remove
"mediatek,share-i3c" for I2C controller driver, so these patches are
just to support the I2C controllers on MT8183 SoC. For the I3C
controller we will send some new patches which are based on i3c
framework directories(kernel/drivers/i3c), not based on
i2c-mt65xx.c.
