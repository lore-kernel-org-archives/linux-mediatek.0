and which one of the two clocks you're writing about is hclk now? I
assume the divided one.

khz for the 2nd time.

I imagined something more hardware related. A list of register (or
register bit fields) that influence the frequency and a formula

	i2c_freq =3D parent_clk / clock-div * (...)

(It seems to be a bit more complicated here as there are two registers
involved that are set differently depending on the target frequency.)

clk_src_in_hz is the module's input rate already divided by clock-div.
This clock-div value is fixed in hardware and unchangeable, right?
Maybe give that divided clock a nice name?

The target frequency is i2c->speed_hz, so among the possible frequencie=
s
we want to pick the highest one that is still less than or equal
i2c->speed_hz, right?

I just notice s/hign/high/ here.
