Ok. You need to specify the type of this property (i.e. that it is a
phandle to a syscon node). The description makes it sound like a boolean.

That doesn't answer my question.

_why_ do you think this needs to be in the DT? What do you think is
better for it being there?

What exactly do you mean by "partial USB ports"?

If a phy isn't wired up, it won't be listed in the phys property, if it
is then disabling it sounds like a run-time decision.

Thanks,
