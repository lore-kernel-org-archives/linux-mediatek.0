This is very verbose. Is it AI generated? Please revise it and make it
suitable for a human. The important part of the commit message is
"Why?", since "What?" can be answered by reading the code.

It is normal to assume phylink is correct. Now, if you do find it
doing the wrong thing, we want to know so we can fix it. So if you do
want to validate it here, make it very noisy if the validation fails.
