That does not look correct to me. Firstly, USB role switches are not
always dual-role USB controllers. Secondly, stating what determines
the role irrelevant IMO.

Since this is a boolean property, the description for it should simply
explain what does it tell about the capabilities of the device that
has it. The description should not make any assumptions about the
users of the property, and since the property is a "generic" USB
property, I'm not sure it should make any assumptions about the type
of the device that has the property either. Also, I would really like
the description to show the type of the property.

Why not just say something like this:

"Boolean property informing that the device is capable of assigning
the USB data role (USB host or USB device) for a given USB connector."
