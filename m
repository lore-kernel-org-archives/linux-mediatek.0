Busy waiting is bad; it is a waste of host CPU processor time and/or power.

When the busy wait occurs after queuing then we will busy wait for
every command we send.

If busy wait occurs before next queuing then we will wait for a
shorter time in total because we have the chance to do something
useful on the host before we have to wait.

Sure, I accept that lock and busy-wait is an appropriate way to ensure
safety (assuming the VPU is fairly quick clearing the HOST_TO_VPU
flag).

No I'm not suggesting that.

I only recommend moving the busy wait *before* end sending of command
(for efficiency reasons mentioned above).
