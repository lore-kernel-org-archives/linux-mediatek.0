We all want to get XYZ in first, but then, you'll see that sometimes having at
least something will help you justify other changes....

If there's nothing upstream, understanding your changes becomes increasingly
difficult (depending on the nature of those changes, of course) - so... just
take the advice: sending the initial DT will help you later in the process ;-)

No, because even though this is the default on many boards, it's still something
board specific, as other boards may define different functions.

Please define that in your board DT.

DSI command mode is not supported upstream - only video mode... and that's why you
can't get your display to work. There's no WDMA driver...

Convert it to video mode and it's gonna work just perfect :-)

P.S.: Also check if your mmsys+mutex configuration is correct!

Downstream, you will find references to "mtcmos" (or anyway cpu mtcmos) - that's
how power domains are called there (I think. At least, in older downstream kernels
that's how they're called - and that's the "real" hw name btw).
