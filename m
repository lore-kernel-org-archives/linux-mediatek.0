Sorry, it would be more accurate to say that the intended mailbox _client_
expects the channels to be bidirectional.

Is there any way for the mailbox framework to inform the client that a channel
is uni/bidirectional? Or if the channel supports RX/TX specifically? I couldn't
find any.

It looks like all of the clients assume one case or the other, based on the
hardware they were initially designed to support. For example arm_scpi expects
one channel per client, while ti_sci and st_remoteproc expect two separate RX
and TX channels per client.

Since there's no API for the client to know the hardware properties, modifying
arm_scpi to support unidirectional mailbox channels would break support for all
existing bidirectional mailboxes.

To expose the physical channels individually, there would need to be an API to:
a) Determine if a mailbox channel supports unidirectional or bidirectional
   operation.
b) If a channel is unidirectional, determine which direction(s) it supports.
c) If a unidirectional channel supports both directions, configure which
   direction it should run in.

Since that API doesn't currently exist, I wrote the driver to match what the
intended client expected (as all other mailbox controller drivers currently do).
