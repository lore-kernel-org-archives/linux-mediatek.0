Ah, thanks for testing! We still don't have a setup with proper

The PROTM_INIT ioctl will certainly require high privilege
CAP_SYS_<something>, dunno yet what that <something> would be though.

Yep, I agree we shouldn't let random users pretend they initialized
protected mode if the system as a whole doesn't have proper the proper
bit hooked up to set that up.
