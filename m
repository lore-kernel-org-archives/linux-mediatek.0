....but the hardware voter cannot be represented as a clock, because you use it
for clocks *or* power domains (but at the same time, and of course in different
drivers, and in different *intertwined* registers).

So the hardware voter itself (and/or bits inside of its registers) cannot be
represented as a clock :\

In the context of clocks, it's used for clocks, (and not touching power domains at
all), but in the context of power domains it's used for power domains (and not
touching clocks at all).

I'm not sure what qcom does - your reply makes me think that they did it such that
the clocks part is in a MMIO and the power domains part is in a different MMIO,
without having clock/pd intertwined voting registers...

Still not sure what to do here, then...

Cheers,
Angelo
