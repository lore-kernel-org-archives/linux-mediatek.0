Dear Andrew,
	Thanks for your comments.

Originally, we recommend equal trace length on PCB, which means that
RGMII delay by PCB traces is not recommended. so only PHY/MAC delay is
taken into account in the transmit/receive path.

as you described above, maybe the equal PCB trace length assumption is
not reasonable, and we'll only handle MAC delay-ps in our driver based
on the device tree information no matter which rgmii is selected.

Since David already applied this patch, I'll send another patch to fix
this issue.

find tune here represents a more accurate delay circuit than coarse
tune, and it's a parallel circuit of coarse tune.
For most delay, both fine and coarse tune can meet the requirement.
It's up to the user to select which one.

But only one of them can work at the same time, so we need a switch
flag(fine_tune here) to indicate which one is valid.
Driver can hardly work out which one is working according to delay-ps.

Please correct me if any misunderstanding.
