Hi, Stephen,
  I'm a bit out of date of the current clock code. Mediatek IOMMU v1
driver will need smi driver to enable iommu clients. And smi driver is
also respond to enable/disable the susbsys clocks for multi-media HW.
The relationship between iommu and smi is like the graphics below[1].

              m4u (Multimedia Memory Management Unit)
               |
           SMI Common(Smart Multimedia Interface Common)
               |
       +----------------+-------
       |                |
       |                |
   SMI larb0        SMI larb1   ... SoCs have several SMI local
arbiter(larb).
   (display)         (vdec)
       |                |
       |                |
 +-----+-----+     +----+----+
 |     |     |     |    |    |
 |     |     |...  |    |    |  ... There are different ports in each
larb.
 |     |     |     |    |    |
OVL0 RDMA0 WDMA0  MC   PP   VLD


When enable SMI driver it will need those subsys clock provider.
But those clocks providers are disabled in default. Since it's needed by
smi driver, and smi was select by MTK_IOMMU_V1, I figure it should be
select by MTK_IOMMU_V1 too.
