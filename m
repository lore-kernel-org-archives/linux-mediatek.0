Hi,

Datasheet doesn't mention detail. So I did some experiments, playing
around with registers. Based on my observation, I think this is what
happens:

For each GPT timer, it has ENABLE, IRQ_EN, IRQ status, IRQ_ACK, counter
& compare.

When mtk_timer_init calls mtk_timer_setup to setup GPT_CLK_EVT, it
enable the timer but didn't set counter or compare. Both counter &
compare is zero on reset, so GPT immediately raise IRQ status. IRQ_EN is
still disabled now, so it didn't trigger interrupt right away.

At end of mtk_timer_init, it calls mtk_timer_enable_irq to enable irq.
Since IRQ status is 1 now, GPT trigger interrupt immediately. The
interrupt is serviced by mtk_timer_interrupt. Since this is not an
expected event, evt->dev.event_handler will be NULL and system crashed
in the handler.

We have 6 GPT on mt8173, mtk timer use 2 of them. The spurious interrupt
only happens on GPT_CLK_EVT (GPT1). Our firmware didn't touch that one,
so it is in reset default when mtk timer driver try to enable it.

Yes. If you applied this series to enable mtk timer without this fix on
mt8173 or mt8135 you can reproduce it. It occurs for every boot.

It crash before uart driver is ready, so you'll have to use earlycon to
see the crash log.

I'm not sure. I believe Matthias test that one on mt6589, maybe it have
different behavior, or different timing.

See above for my analysis.
Thanks.
