Yeah, I'm not entirely sold on this approach either, but I thought it

Unfortunately, there's so many ways this can go wrong, because we're
not just talking about FW exec sections, but also data buffers that
have to be dynamically allocated by userspace (suspend buffers for GPU
contexts, textures/framebuffers, decode frames, ...). If there's no
central component kernel-side we can refer to to check correctness, the
only safe guard is privilege-based restriction...
