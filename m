If you can substantiate a claim that the current setup doesn't actually
work for these devices (which seems plausible), you can justify changing
the ABI on that basis.

Usually when making ABI changes because something was inaccurate (but
not wrong to the point that it didn't work at all) it's possible to
support both new and old ABIs at the same time because of new properties
etc. This is a difficult one because it's using the same properties in
different ways. A new compatible would definitely be required for a
genuine fresh start while retaining kernel support for the old mechanism
in this case.

But as I said, if what's in the kernel right now does not work at all,
then you can probably just rework in place. Your commit messages will
have to be very clear about why what you're doing is okay however.
It'd probably be best to try to detect the old devicetrees (if that's
even possible, will be tricky unless the devices you're moving are the
ones that need mediatek,pctl-regmap) and reject probe.
