SRCU neatly solves the lifetime management issues. The wrapper lives as
long as anyone (provider or user) holds a reference. A PCS can disappear
at any point and everything still works (although the link goes down).
Device links are only an optimization; they cannot be relied on for
correctness.

Which is why you grab the PCS in probe. If you want to be more dynamic,
you can do it in netdev open like is done for PHYs.

This all works correctly due to device links. The only case that doesn't
work automatically is something like

MAC built-in
  MDIO built-in
    PCS module

where the PCS module gets loaded late. In that case you have to manually
re-probe the MAC. I think the best way to address this would be to grab
the PCS in netdev open so that the MAC can probe without the PCS.

This works just fine. There are two cases:

- If the PCS has an IRQ, we notify phylink and then it polls the PCS
  (see below).
- If the PCS is polled, phylink will call pcs_get_state and see that the
  link is down.

Either way, the link goes down. But bringing the link back up is pretty
unusual anyway. Unlike PHYs (which theoretically can be on removable
busses) PCSs are generally permanently attached to their MACs. The only
removable scenario I can think of is if the PCS is on an FPGA and the
MAC is not.

So if the PCS goes away, the MAC is likely to follow shortly after
(since the whole thing is on a removable bus). Or someone has manually
removed the PCS, in which case I think it's reasonable to have them
manually remove the MAC as well. If you really want to support this,
then just grab the PCS in netdev open.

To avoid adding overhead for the majority of PCSs where the PCS is built
into the MAC and literally can't be removed. We only pay the price for
dynamicism on the drivers where it matters.

OK, but then how does the MAC select the PCS? If there are multiple PCSs
then ultimately someone has to configure a mux somewhere.

This is difficult to work with for existing drivers. Many of them have
non-standard ways of looking up their PCS that they need to support for
backwards-compatibility. And some of them create the PCS themselves
(such as if they are PCI devices with internal MDIO busses). It's much
easier for the MAC to create or look up the PCS itself and then hand it
off to phylink.

Sure. And I think we were starting from a clean slate then this would be
the obvious way to do things. But we must support existing drivers and
provide an upgrade path for them. This is why I favor an incremental
approach.
