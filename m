Right, the very reason we need protected memory early is because some
FW sections need to be allocated from the protected pool, otherwise the
TEE will fault as soon at the FW enters the so-called 'protected mode'.

Now, it's not impossible to work around this limitation. For instance,
we could load the FW without this protected section by default (what we
do right now), and then provide a DRM_PANTHOR_ENABLE_FW_PROT_MODE
ioctl that would take a GEM object imported from a dmabuf allocated
from the protected dma-heap by userspace. We can then reset the FW and
allow it to operate in protected mode after that point. This approach
has two downsides though:

1. We have no way of checking that the memory we're passed is actually
suitable for FW execution in a protected context. If we're passed
random memory, this will likely hang the platform as soon as we enter
protected mode.

2. If the driver already boot the FW and exposed a DRI node, we might
have GPU workloads running, and doing a FW reset might incur a slight
delay in GPU jobs execution.

I think #1 is a more general issue that applies to suspend buffers
allocated for GPU contexts too. If we expose ioctls where we take
protected memory buffers that can possibly lead to crashes if they are
not real protected memory regions, and we have no way to ensure the
memory is protected, we probably want to restrict these ioctls/modes to
some high-privilege CAP_SYS_.

For #2, that's probably something we can live with, since it's a
one-shot thing. If it becomes an issue, we can even make sure we enable
the FW protected-mode before the GPU starts being used for real.

This being said, I think the problem applies outside Panthor, and it
might be that the video codec can't reset the FW/HW block to switch to
protected mode as easily as Panthor.

Note that there's also downsides to the reserved-memory node approach,
where some bootloader stage would ask the secure FW to reserve a
portion of mem and pass this through the DT. This sort of things tend to
be an integration mess, where you need all the pieces of the stack (TEE,
u-boot, MTK dma-heap driver, gbm, ...) to be at a certain version to
work properly. If we go the ioctl() way, we restrict the scope to the
TEE, gbm/mesa and the protected-dma-heap driver, which is still a lot,
but we've ripped the bootloader out of the equation at least.

Regards,

Boris
