Yeah, I've not yet managed to try pulling in that series (much as I 
approve of it), partly as I know doing so is going to lean towards a 
not-insignificant rework and I'd rather avoid picking up more unmerged 
dependencies to block getting _something_ in for arm64 (which we can 
then improve).

Calling arch_setup_dma_ops() from the driver looks plain wrong, 
especially given that you apparently attach the IOMMU to itself - if you 
want your own domain you should use iommu_dma_create_domain(). I admit 
that still leaves you having to dance around a bit in order to tear down 
the automatic domains for now, but hopefully we'll get the core code 
sorted out sooner rather than later.

If you implemented a simple of_xlate callback so that the core code 
handles the dma_ops as intended, I think the simplest cheat would be to 
check the client device's domain, either on attachment or when they 
start mapping/unmapping, and move them to your own domain if necessary. 
I'm putting together a v3 of the DMA mapping series, so I'll have a look 
to see if I can squeeze in a way to make that a bit less painful until 
we solve it properly.
