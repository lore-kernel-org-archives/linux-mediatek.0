If using DPCM, it seems the most suitable FE DAIs will be memif, and
external interface like I2S should be BE DAIs. Do you think it is
suitable for our memif to be FE DAIs? Then which memif to used can be
described in a machine driver's FE DAIs. But I think this has a problem
that our memif is one-direction, playback or capture. So the binded pcm
device cannot have playback and capture capability together. May it
cause trouble for user space apps that assumes there will be pcmC0D0p,
pcmC0D0c?
