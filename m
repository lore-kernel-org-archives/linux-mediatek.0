There is no fix yes. Your fix is basically correct. I was mistaken back
when I told you and Stephen that the framework already took care of
this.

However, instead of "open coding" this solution, I would rather re-use
the __clk_set_parent_{before,after} helpers instead. Can you review/test
the following patch and let me know what you think?

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: [PATCH] clk: migrate ref counts when orphans are reunited

It's always nice to see families reunited, and this is equally true when
talking about parent clocks and their children. However, if the orphan
clk had a positive prepare_count or enable_count, then we would not
migrate those counts up the parent chain correctly.

This has manifested with the recent critical clocks feature, which often
enables clocks very early, before their parents have been registered.

Fixed by replacing the call to clk_core_reparent with calls to
__clk_set_parent_{before,after}.
