What about boards where the ID pin is *not* connected to a GPIO,
but e.g. to a special pin on the PMIC which can also detect
an ACA adapter ? Currently this case is handled by extcon
drivers, but we have no way to set e.g. vbus-supply for the
connector. Maybe in this case the usb-connector node should
be a child of the PMIC node ?

And in many cases there also is a mux to switch the datalines
between the host and device(gadget) controllers, how should
that be described in this model?  See the new usb-role-switch
code under drivers/usb/roles

In some cases the mux is controlled through a gpio, so we
may want to add a "mux-gpios" here in which case we also
need to define what 0/1 means.

I think this needs some text that there can be either a vbus-gpio or
a vbus-supply. Oh wait reading:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10819377/

I see that this GPIO is for detecting vbus presence, not for driving/enabling
5v to Vbus from the board, that needs to be described more clearly.
