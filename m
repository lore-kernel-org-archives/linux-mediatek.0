I'm not sure I'd say it works properly in all cases. If we're placing
modules in the vmalloc area, then the piece of VA space below that shouldn't
be treated as the module area, otherwise we could say that
is_vmalloc_or_module_addr() could return 1 for all areas of unused VA
space, which I don't think is right.

Sure, but what use is there in communicating the module region if we don't
actually load modules there? It only serves to confuse people IMO.
