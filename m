As Documentation/DMA-API.txt says, the parameters to dma_sync_sg_* must 
be the same as those originally passed into dma_map_sg. The segments are 
only merged *from the point of view of the device*: if I have a 
scatterlist of two discontiguous 4K segments, I can remap them with an 
IOMMU so the device sees them as a single 8K buffer, and tell it as 
such. If on the other hand I want to do maintenance from the CPU side 
(i.e. any DMA API call), then those DMA addresses mean nothing and I can 
only operate on the CPU addresses of the underlying pages, which are 
still very much discontiguous in the linear map; ergo I still need to 
iterate over the original entries.

Whilst I can't claim much familiarity with v4l itself, from a brief look 
over the existing code this patch does look to be doing the right thing.

Robin.
