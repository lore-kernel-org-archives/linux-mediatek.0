I don't really know.
I was hoping someone would know of a way to add a "delay" when
enabling a clock gate. :-)
Why do we need the delay anyway?
Is the delay really between LPF and OUT_EN?
Or, is the delay between enabling OUT_EN and when the USB block can
use the clock?

Some ideas:
(1) Handled the LPF delay in the USB driver itself:
  (a) if the delay is really between OUT_EN and when it is used:
  /* Enabling USB_OUT will enable its parents, USB_LPF and USB_TX */
  clk_enable(clk_usb_out);
  udelay();

  (b) Or if the delay is really needed between LPF and OUT, this can
be implemented in the USB driver:

  /* Enable LPF and its parent USB_TX */
  clk_enable(clk_lpf);
  udelay();
  clk_enable(clk_usb_out);

 (2) Add a "delay" property to "struct mtk_clk_gate", with a non-zero
value for just this one special LPF clock.  The downside is then every
gate clock would have to carry this extra field.

 (3) Add a new clk type, struct mtk_clk_delayed_gate, that includes a
struct mtk_clk_gate, plus a delay.  I would add this to its own file,
or maybe clk-gate.c, though, rather than mediatek/clk-mt8173.c.  And
then use this for instantiating the LPF clock.
