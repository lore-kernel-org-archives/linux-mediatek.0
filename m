So this is RTL8367S-CG, which is a switch.  It's entirely possible that
it really does support what it says it does.

Right, so this suggests that it only supports 1000BASE-X and 2500BASE-X
via the normal method of "over-clocking" 1000BASE-X.

1000BASE-X and SGMII are compatible _if_ and only if you ignore the
contents of the 16-bit control word which is used for auto-negotiation
in the case of 1000BASE-X, or for communicating the negotiation results
in the case of SGMII.  Apart from that 16-bit control word, and the
semantics of it, at the data link level the two are the same.

I think the above is why you have to force the link: a link consisting
of one end configured for SGMII and the other end configured for
1000BASE-X is not a good idea at the best of times, but if you ignore
the 16-bit control word and force it, it will work.

What this means is that you _should_ be forcing it in DT to be a
fixed link, and not trying to do auto-neg.

phylink_mac_link_status() is expected to read the results of SGMII
or 1000BASE-X negotiation at the MAC side of the link.  To see why,
consider a fiber link:

MAC-PCS --- SFP ----- fiber ----- SFP --- MAC-PCS

The fiber is passive, the SFP merely converts between light and
electrical signals - there's nothing apart from the MAC's own PCS
that can report what the negotiation state of the link is.  So,
you need to read from whatever bit of hardware on the MAC side
which will report that - basically, the results of the 1000BASE-X
negotiation.

phylink currently expects results from the PCS to be automatically
propagated to the MAC through hardware, since that's what happens
on Marvell setups - however, that can be changed if there are
setups which need manual propagation.

If we do need to do that, I'd suggest we rename
phylink_mac_link_status() to be phylink_macpcs_link_status() to
clarify which bit of hardware it's supposed to be reading from.

I'm really not in favour of "sgmii" being used to also describe the
over-clocked SGMII variants.  It's a different protocol - many data
sheets (e.g. for PHYs that support it) explicitly state that the
speed bits in the SGMII 16-bit control word are not valid, and
over-clocked vs normal SGMII can not be auto-negotiated.  Both ends
must be running at the same speed in order to successfully transfer
even the 16-bit control word that dictates the link speed.

So, SGMII at 3.125Gbps is really a different interface mode from
SGMII at 1.25Gbps.
