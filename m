Hi David,

> Series applied, thank you.

I did probably something terribly wrong, but patch "[PATCH v4 05/10] net:
ethernet: support of_get_mac_address new ERR_PTR error" has not reached the
patchwork, but I'm sure, that it was sent out as Hauke Mehrtens (maintainer
for ethernet/lantiq_xrx200.c) has confirmed to me on IRC, that he has received
it.

I've as well noticed, that you've not considered "[PATCH v5] staging:
octeon-ethernet: support of_get_mac_address new ERR_PTR error"[1] which
contained a fix for possible NULL value of mac variable:

        const u8 *mac = NULL;

        if (priv->of_node)
                mac = of_get_mac_address(priv->of_node);

        if (!IS_ERR(mac))

I'll send those two patches again against net-next in a few moments. Sorry for
this mess.
