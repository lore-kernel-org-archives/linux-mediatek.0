The marvell case is not a good example for your case: their top-level
device is made up by the OS to help with the shared resource allocation,
while in your case the bus bridge actually exists in hardware.

I'm not too familiar with the Tegra case, and haven't looked at that here,
but it could be an artifact of how for a while we used to list the config
space access in the top-level "ranges" instead of the "reg" property.

I'd vote for moving it back, for consistency with the other port specific
properties that are now in the root node. Once you do that, the port
nodes can be removed completely, which is what I was aiming for with
the comments on the previous version.

Not entirely sure what happens here, but I guess the problem
is that the 'reg' portion of the parent interrupt-map refers to
the port devices, not the devices attached the devices behind
them.

On a related note, I see that you still list

This seems to be an artifact from the older version and should be
removed as the driver correctly ignores the properties now.
