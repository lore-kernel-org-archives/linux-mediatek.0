And forcing userspace to figure it all out is also an unsolved problem
after all these years. Neither side wants to get their hands dirty, but
it is fundamentally a kernel problem to handle these device complexities.

DMA-buf attach and map stages are split from each other, to me this indicates
the design intended the actual backing allocation to be chosen based on attached
devices at map time, not at allocation time. Meaning userspace doesn't really get
to choose the backing storage.

This sounds like the kernel provided "hints" solution. Given enough hints,
the correct Heap would become obvious, and so a complete hint based solution
is one step away from just having the kernel simply make that one correct
selection for you.

Agree with the first part, some exporters are just giving out CPU memory
but with some specific constraint (some subsystems get a pass like V4L2
as it came out before DMA-heaps, but no reason to keep making new allocators
for each and every subsystem just because they may have some memory
constraint on the consumption side).

Importing the buffer to a given subsystem with be subsystem specific yes,
but I don't see how that means allocating the buffer should have to be too.
For instance I need one of these new "restricted" heaps to pass to V4L2,
I'll need to know how to use V4L2 sure, but why should I have to deal with
the TEE subsystem to get that buffer as proposed? The common allocator
could have handled this.

And in this case, attaching the DMA-buf to that monitor for scanout
should fail at attach time, if we had a way to properly communicate
constraints between importer and exporter..

Why not? For instance when we attach a buffer for scanout we provide
all the format/stride/etc info. What we are missing is a backchannel
to provide these to the exporter as a set of constraints that those
formats impose on a memory area for a given device.

Agree, we cannot be doing conversions like that in-kernel. We need
the format and constraints solved at an earlier step.
