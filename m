They don't come from IORT only but that does not matter much. The point is,
we have got to have a standard way for device drivers to retrieve a HW
IRQ number for devices created out of static tables (and only code that
knows what a static table represents can initialize such fwnodes because
the interrupt fields are different in different static tables).
