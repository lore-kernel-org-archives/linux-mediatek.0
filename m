Right, as I suspected, if it's primarily about the map path then the 
answer is to use the existing API intended to accommodate that specific 
case; if that API doesn't quite do what you need, then just fix it! It 
doesn't make sense to clutter up the IOMMU core with multiple 
overlapping APIs for TLB invalidation, especially when TLB invalidation 
ultimately isn't all that complicated.

So if your hardware doesn't care about the granule size used for 
invalidation matching the underlying mapping, use an implementation of 
iommu_flush_ops::tlb_add_page that doesn't care about the granule size!

I know I'm probably more familiar with this code than most people, but 
from my perspective, this reads like "my car was dirty, so I had to buy 
a new car" ;)

The first, and so far only, user of this API is the Tegra GART, which 
can only do a "flush all" operation, so the API is currently only as 
complex as it needs to be, which is to say "not very". There are plenty 
of options.

And as I said, that quirk is implemented in a really simplistic way, 
which is sure to be functionally correct, but has never been given any 
performance consideration.

Getting rid of IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_TLBI_ON_MAP and simply wiring 
.iotlb_sync_map to .flush_iotlb_all is certainly the easiest way to make 
.map quicker, although it will obviously have *some* impact on any other 
live mappings. Given that in principle this should have the least CPU 
overhead, then depending on TLB usage patterns there's a small chance it 
might actually work out as a reasonable tradeoff, so I wouldn't 
necessarily rule it out as a viable option without at least trying some 
tests.

If it's cheap to *issue* invalidation commands, and the expense is in 
waiting for them to actually complete, then you could still fire off an 
invalidate for each page from .map, then wire up the sync (wait) step to 
.iotlb_sync_map, still without needing any core changes.

Otherwise, it would seem reasonable to pass the complete address and 
size of the iommu_map() operation to .iotlb_sync_map, so drivers can 
perform their whole invalidation operation synchronously there.

What I *don't* think makes sense is to try passing a gather structure 
through .map in the same way as for .unmap. That seems a bit too 
invasive for what is still a fairly exceptional case, and half the stuff 
that unmap operations will use the gather data for - freelists and such 
- won't ever be relevant to map operations, so symmetry isn't really an 
argument either.
