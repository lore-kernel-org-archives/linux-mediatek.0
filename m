The situation is more complex than you mentioned above. VENC (0x18000000
~ 0x1800ffff) for example, if we want to avoid hanging up while
accessing registers, we need to:
 
 - Prevent venc_sel off while VENC is powered on.
 - Prevent mm_sel off while MM is powered on.

First, it's not worth to control power domains in clock control path
because it's too expensive. So we want to keep clock on before accessing
registers or during the domain is powered on.

Besides, modeling a clock controller as a consumer of power domain may
not a good idea, because there are power domains be consumers of clocks,
such as:

	[MT8173_POWER_DOMAIN_MM] = {
		.name = "mm",
		[...]
		.clk_id = MT8173_CLK_MM,
		[...]
	},

Second, if we want to avoid hanging up by enabling related top clocks in
clock controllers, we need to clock on venc_sel and mm_sel before *each
clock operations*, and then clock off them after clock operations. That
means:

- To check venc_cke0's state:
 = clk_prepare mm_sel and venc_sel (where to prepare?)
  - It may turn on related PLLs, and it can't be invoked in an atomic
context.
 = clk_enable mm_sel and venc_sel.
 = Read VENC's clock register.
 = clk_disable mm_sel and venc_sel.
 = clk_unprepare mm_sel and venc_sel (where to unprepare?)
  - It may turn off PLLs, and it can't be invoked in an atomic context.
 = Return venc_cke0's state.

Overhead is a reason. The clock framework's API flow (prepare - enable -
disable - unprepare) is another reason to reject the solution in clock
controllers, because prepare/unprepare is a non-atomic operation but
operations to access registers may be a atomic context.



Best regards,

James
