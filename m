This series have been pending for half an year, would you keep going on
this series? If you're busy, I could complete this series, but I need to
know what you have plan to do.

I guess that 1/12 ~ 5/12 is for MT2701/MT8173 and that patches meet this
discussion. 6/12 ~ 12/12 is for MT2712/MT6797 but that patches does not
meet this discussion. So the unfinished work is to make MT2712/MT6797 to
align MT2701/MT8173, is this right?
