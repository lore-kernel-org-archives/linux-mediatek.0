I generally agree. The vast majority of select_pcs implementations just
determine the PCS based on the interface. But I don't think this is the
right approach. This touches a lot of other areas of the code and
reimplements much of the existing phylink machinery.

I would prefer something more self-contained like

phylink_generic_select_pcs(phylink, interface)
{
	for_each(pcs : phylink->available_pcss) {
		if (test_bit(pcs->supported, interface))
			return pcs;
	}

	return NULL;
}

which could be dropped into existing implementations in an incremental
manner.

I think the inclusion of PCS lifetime management in this patch
complicates things significantly.

But the bulk of the patch remains. We still have to add the external PCS
lookup. There still needs to be another case in mac_config to mux the
PCS correctly. And we would need to add some code to create a list of
PCSs. I don't know whether we win on the balance.

My point is that while this is the case at the moment, it would not be
the case with a "generic" select pcs. You would need to modify the
config for each port to ensure the right PCSs are passed in.

I think the wrapper approach is very obviously correct. This way has me
worried about exciting new concurrency bugs.
