Hmm... below is my current understanding.

In the current software architecture, we have split the "venc"
subsystem register space into two parts (two dt nodes), with each node
handled instantiated as its own  platform device, and handled by a
different platform driver:

vencsys: clock-controller@18000000 {
  compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-vencsys", "syscon";
  reg = <0 0x18000000 0 0x1000>;
  #clock-cells = <1>;
};

/* TBD - a venc driver has not been posted to the list so I don't
really know yet what it will look like */
 venc: encoder@~18000000 {
   compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-venc?";
   reg = <0 ~0x18000000 0 ?>;
   clocks = <& <&vencsys CLK_VENC_CKE1>, <&vencsys CLK_VENC_CKE0>, ...;
   clock-names = "apb", "smi", ...;
   ...
 };

Each independent driver must take appropriate independent action to
ensure that any clock required to access its associated registers is
enabled when accessing said registers.
In other words,
 * the venc *clock-controller* driver that must enable any clocks
required to access the *clock control* registers
 * the venc *encoder* driver must enable clocks any clocks required to
access the *encoder* registers

Actually, the situation is a little worse that this, since we also
have a 'larb' node in the same register space, whose driver must also
ensure that VENC_SEL is enabled before accessing its registers:

larb3: larb@18001000 {
  compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-smi-larb";
  reg = <0 0x18001000 0 0x1000>;
  mediatek,smi = <&smi_common>;
  power-domains = <&scpsys MT8173_POWER_DOMAIN_VENC>;
  clocks = <&vencsys CLK_VENC_CKE1>, <&vencsys CLK_VENC_CKE0>;
  clock-names = "apb", "smi";
};

Personally, I am not opposed to using the power-domain enable/disable
as a proxy for also enabling/disabling the "subsystem register bank"
clock as is done in this patch and by the scpsys driver in general.
However, it feels a bit like an abuse of the power domain api.

The misunderstanding here is the interpretation of "VENC's registers".
In this case, the registers in question are those owned by the
"vencsys: clock-controller@18000000" node, and the driver accessing
them is drivers/clk/mediatek/clk-gate.c.
