Eeeeeeh....

....well..... drivers/soc/mediatek/mtk-infracfg.c - read that driver: are you still
sure about what you're saying now? :-P

P.S.: We tried the same trick with MT8183, but that needs more than just that, and
it's anyway a very suboptimal (and ugly) solution anyway.

That can be a real possibility. Try to apply the same patch on 8192 domains, and
see if and which power domains are kept on in the MFlexGraphics island (you'll see
a print saying that a default off domain "has been on").

In the audio case, since there's no stall, a cleaner solution could be to trigger a
full reset on the ADSP and on the AFE/PCM/whatever.

There should be a reset register for that.

Alternatively, the drivers are assuming that the device starts from a clean known
state, so some registers are not set as they are left to the initial default state:
adding writes to force those in default state could also be an option... but then
that depends on how many, because otherwise just asserting reset is simply a better
option.

It's probably due to how MediaTek SoCs are internally structured: I didn't check
on 8186 or 83 specifically, but it's likely that the multimedia IP block (which
also contains multimedia clock controllers, which are powered by multimedia power
domains!!!!) is providing some clock source to some audio related gate (or PLL
even).

When the clock source for the whatever audio related IP is turned off, the IP is
getting in a unclocked state (or even unpowered, depending on what's actually going
on), so when it gets re-clocked, said IP restarts like it was reset with register
defaults - then you get a "known and clean" (is it really clean if this is what is
happening? ugh!) state for the initialization sequence to go on Just Fine (TM).

That could be an explanation... but then please take all this with a grain of salt,
I'm doing an information dump here hoping to help you somehow with this, but I can
not be certain of what's going on unless I really analyze the specific issue on HW.

Luck and just the right defconfig, where the right drivers never -EPROBE_DEFER,
and the whole boot process doesn't take "too much time". That's why.

For Dmitry the hang didn't happen all the time either, it did depend on both how
much time it was required for booting and on probe deferrals.

Multiple SoCs... MediaTek? Qualcomm? NXP? And which models?

This thing, anyway, all started since sync_state() was introduced in power domains:
it wasn't an issue before, and AFAIK that actually made more platforms to regress.

I'm not blaming anyone though... this only means that many platforms had some
"hidden" bug (or an easter egg, if you wish? :-P) that was power domain related...
..when you have such situations, it's only a matter of time until something goes
wrong... in this case it all started going wrong with sync_state, but it could've
been worst, or could've happened in other racy ways which would've been way harder
to debug, etc.

Cheers,
Angelo
