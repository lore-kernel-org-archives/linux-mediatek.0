It depends on implementation; there are two phys on mt8173 platform

Syscon-wakeup is used to control which usb wakeup mode we want to use,
such as ip sleep(usb suspend/resume signal), or line state(changes of D
+/-). And it doesn't trigger device's interrupt, so can't implement
device's irq to wake up system.

It is the former case, and has little relation with sysfs interface.
I will modify it later, sorry for my unclear description.

Yes, the mtk's usb3 controller contains three parts: mu3d IP, xHCI IP
and IPPC (IP power and control).
