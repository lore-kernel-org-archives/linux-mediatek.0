Sean Wang reported dma_zalloc_coherent doesn't work as expect on his
armv7,the allocated mem is not zeroed.The reason is __alloc_from_pool
doesn't honor __GFP_ZERO.

As commit 6829e274a623 ("arm64: dma-mapping: always clear allocated buffers")
has pointed out,buffers allocated by dma_alloc_coherent() are always zeroed
on most architectures. some drivers rely on this 'feature'. Allocated buffer
might be also exposed to userspace with dma_mmap() call,so clearing it is
desired from security point of view to avoid exposing random memory to userspace.

This patch unifies dma_alloc_coherent() behavior on ARM architecture with other
implementations by unconditionally zeroing allocated buffer.Also to fix
dma_zalloc_coherent behavior.
