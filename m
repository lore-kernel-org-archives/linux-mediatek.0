There's no Chromebook with HDMI TX, only DP.

The only boards exposing the HDMI connector routed through the HDMI TX Controller
are:
  - Radxa NIO 12L  (MT8195)
  - Genio 1200 EVK (MT8195)
  - Genio 700 EVK  (MT8188)

Should a Chromebook featuring HDMI TX appear, we can go with heavy power related
optimization later, there's no problem (besides, again, it's about some microamps
and nothing more).

The power consumption was measured with a Joulescope JS110 on the Genio 700 EVK.
I didn't save the current measurement values, and I peformed those 3 weeks ago
so I don't remember the exact values - what I remember is that there was a
difference of microamps (18650 battery 4.2V -> JS110 -> board), but nothing more.

Angelo
