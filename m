yes, we'll set the corresponding register based on the
tx-delay-ps/rx-delay-ps in device tree for rgmii interface.
the PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII/-RXID/-TXID/-ID share the same flow in
Ethernet driver.

A new patch will be sent to fix this issue.

yes, since fine tune is more accurate, and can meet customer's
requirement, we'll remove the 'fine-tune' property in device tree,
enable fine-tune circuit by default in Ethernet driver, and abandon the
coarse delay mechanism. so customer will not be confused by the options.

I'll send a new patch to fix this issue.
