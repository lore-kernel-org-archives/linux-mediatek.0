NAK.  I still do not see why we need to introduce clk_null.  Just
model the real clock tree.

Every clock listed with "clk_null" as its parent actually has a real
parent clock.
As mentioned elsewhere, it is not enough to just enable/disable a clock gate.
Clock enables/disables propagate up to parent clocks, and ensure that
parents themselves are enabled when any child is enabled, and disabled
when all of its children are disabled.
So, we must properly configure each clock's parent to ensure that its
parent will be enabled when needed, and that it can be disabled to
save power when no longer required.

Creating a bogus clk_null breaks the clock tree model, potentially
causing real issues when enabling/disabling clocks.

Please ask your hardware team to specify the real parent clock for
each of the clocks below so we can model the clock tree accurately.

In addition, these four need not be defined at all.  We can just use
their parent clocks directly.
As Sascha eloquently put it: "There's no need to model pieces of wire in CCF."

FACTOR(CLK_TOP_CLKPH_MCK_O, "clkph_mck_o", "clk_null", 1, 1),
FACTOR(CLK_TOP_DPI, "dpi_ck", "clk_null", 1, 1),
FACTOR(CLK_TOP_USB_SYSPLL_125M, "usb_syspll_125m", "clk_null", 1, 1),
FACTOR(CLK_TOP_HDMITX_DIG_CTS, "hdmitx_dig_cts", "clk_null", 1, 1),


For these "clk_null as parent" gate clocks, please specify their real
parent clock:

GATE_ICG(CLK_INFRA_CPUM, "infra_cpum", "clk_null", 15),
GATE_MM1(CLK_MM_DSI0_DIGITAL, "mm_dsi0_digital", "clk_null", 5),
GATE_MM1(CLK_MM_DSI1_DIGITAL, "mm_dsi1_digital", "clk_null", 7),
GATE_MM1(CLK_MM_DPI1_PIXEL, "mm_dpi1_pixel", "clk_null", 10),
GATE_MM1(CLK_MM_LVDS_PIXEL, "mm_lvds_pixel", "clk_null", 16),
GATE_MM1(CLK_MM_LVDS_CTS, "mm_lvds_cts", "clk_null", 17),

Thanks,
