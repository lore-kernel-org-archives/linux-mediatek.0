Oh, perhaps I missed something before. Your words were a bit unclear to
me at first glance.

You previous reply said "wake on Bluetooth". I interpreted it as USB
remote wakeup upon Bluetooch device connection.

"Wakeup by Bluetooth" is clearer. You meant using the Bluetooth
interface as a wakeup source to wake up the system from sleep, right?

Hmm, it makes more sense to me.

My patch was inspired by commit f4292e2faf52 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Make
the CSR clone chip force-suspend workaround more generic"). The
mentioned commit is correct as the quirky chips can't perform remote
wakeup at all.

If MT7922/MT7925 can reliably wake up the system from sleep, my patch
could be a burden. I won't insist anymore if you'd like to revert it.

I plan to submit another patch to properly fix it next week. In general,
I will:

- narrow the quirk down to AMD platforms only
- disable USB remote wakeup for runtime autosuspend only
- leave the wakeup source as is, so users can enable "wakeup by
Bluetooth" even on AMD platforms if they really want it

Hopefully it will minimize the impact of the workaround.

Thanks,
Rong
