Hi Russell,

Thanks for your review and many useful comments and explanations.

I shall add the 1000baseX modes.

My device, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X SFP, has this setup.
Port 5 is connected to a at8033 phy which acts as a RGMII-SerDes converter for
the SFP cage. According to the datasheet it only support 100BASE-FX and
1000BASE-X. With bootstrap resistors the PHY is put in RGMII-SerDes 1000BASE-X
mode.

The problem I had is that the current mainline driver doesn't support  
this mode
so I had to hack it in myself [0][1]. I probably doing the wrong thing with my
phy driver. Driver works for me, it detects a link and sets-up a 1gbit link.
So I can test port 5. But the driver may report all the wrong values to
PHYLIB/PHYLINK. But now that I learned more about it I can revise the driver.


By reading your previous emails, my setup could official not support the
FiberStore SFP-GB-GE-T module, because it requests a SGMII interface.
But my PHY only supports 1000BaseX and my code currently doesn't error out.

dmesg output of this module:

What is the best way to do it in case of SGMII interface request?
Return that we don't support SGMII or report that we only support 1  
mode and no
auto-negotiation?

Greats,

René
