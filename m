reading the rest of the email you seem to be quite agro about this.

what should i pick my nose about ? i made mt7623 work, then waited for
4.10-rc1 to be out for clk-mt2701 so that i can continue adding the
missing support

ok, that info is most likely under NDA

in that case add a dtsi file for the EVB and include it in your geek
board.dts and only update the compat string.

1) at the time we adde this the uart support was not ready
2) the bootloader i am using is a custom built one hence the random baudrate
3) you can just updae the license if you want to, no problem

you do have the EVB directly in front of you

i dont need the geek board as i have the EVB and they are identical
according to MTK

see above

agreed, i never even mentioned 4/4

the idea is that we work together to make thins optimal. this is not a
you or is right. this is about the FOSS peer review process. please dont
be so agro.

to me it seems suboptimal to support 2 dts files for the same board.
