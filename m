Okay in MT8196 that was updated then.

On any other SoC previous to MT8196, the datasheet name is
"MediaTek Flexible Graphics (MFG)".

If you want to keep "MFlexGraphics" in MT8196-style, it's still a good idea to also
reference somewhere the old "MediaTek Flexible Graphics" name, as that was used for
more than 10 years. Really.

Yeah but still, it feels like this naming is MT8196-specific, and this driver is
not entirely specific to this SoC (this version is, but with minor modifications
this can work on other chips as well).

 > I think it's some sort of silicon revision.

It is. And there's a broad range of names that you can use in place of "e2_id"...

If there's no precise name, always go with something that is generic enough but
that resembles what can be found inside of the mmio that you're specifying.

"fast-dvfs-event" would be good, wouldn't it? :-)

I really doubt that this is ever getting used at all for GPUFreq, so yes, leave it
out.

P.S.: of course I was implying that if we ever need to support those, we can always
add them later (but I still really doubt that we're ever going to use MET at all,
even though it would be *really* nice to).

Not sure if gpufreq needs to poke that channel to tell to the ppb "I'm setting this
frequency here", or if the MCUs can communicate that stuff on their own.
I didn't do any research about that.

Since adding stuff is kinda easier than removing, I guess avoiding to add this for
now is a sensible option. Let's do just that then.
