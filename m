I'm replying to this thread while I'm also trying to cover some discussion in the
DT patch series.

What we're trying to solve is this: the Mali GPUs have an L2$+bits power domain
that in upstream ended up being called 'sram' for reasons. The domain is important
both for ultimate power savings (you can turn off most of the other GPU domains
and preserve enough state for the GPU to wake up on an interrupt) and for normal
operations, for obvious reasons. Now, vendors either don't bother to put a
separate domain just for "sram" or go to the extreme of handing over control over
that domain to an MCU that implements aggresive and system-wide policies. We're
trying to cater for all cases, include the (currently hypotetical) one where you
have a separate "sram" power domain that Linux can control.

When we have first upstreamed the bindings, inspired by Panfrost driver, we have
added the sram-supply as mandatory which I think is turning out to be a mistake.
Prompted by Mark Brown's reply[1] to Tyr adding 'sram-supply' as an optional
property, Onur has started this and the DT patch series[2] to enforce the presence
of an 'sram-supply' to reduce the number of warnings in dtbs_check. In reality
what we are enforcing is a dummy supply that is the same as the one the GPU is using
because most of the systems don't have a specific one.

So the problem we have is: do we change the upstream binding and make 'sram-supply'
optional for every compatible string given that it is unlikely to be provided (and
the code did not enforce it in panthor_devfreq.c anyway from the beginning), or
do we accept that this power domain is important but usually not specified and we
go with the current DT patch series that provides one?

I agree, if we go with "sram-supply" being optional only for mt8196-mali then we should
put this in the panthor_soc_data payload and here we use that.

So what should we do when dtbs_check catches it? Series [2] is trying to provide
a supply, but it is a bogus one because in reality the vendors don't declare one.
