A GCE command is arg_a + arg_b. Both of them have 32 bits length.
arg_a is op + subsys + addr, and arg_b is value.
subsys + addr is less than 32bits, so we need to map address range to
subsys.
The mapping rule is defined by hardware.

It is (b).

How about this?
hardware_module = <address_base subsys_id mask>;
So, the result is
mmsys_config_base = <0x14000000 1 0xffff0000>;
disp_rdma_config_base = <0x14010000 2 0xffff0000>;
disp_mutex_config_base = <0x14020000 3 0xffff0000>;
