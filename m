It is entirely the job of the TEE to prevent this. Nothing in the
kernel should allow exploitation of what happens in the TEE no matter
what goes on in the kernel

That's a really good point. So one of the other models that is used
for secure video decoding is to send the encrypted buffer into the
video decoder directly (i.e. V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP) and then also send in
all the corresponding crypto parameters (i.e. algorithm, IV,
encryption pattern, etc.). Then the video driver internally does the
decryption and decode in one operation.  That's not what we want to
use here for Mediatek; but I've done other integrations that work that
way (that was for VAAPI [1], not V4L2...but there are other ARM
implementations that do operate that way).  So if we end up requiring
V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF_SECURE to indicate secure mode and enforce it on
output+capture, that'll close off other potential solutions in the
future.

Expanding on your point about DMA operations being different on
various hardware, that also makes me think a general check for this in
v4l2 code may also be limiting. There are various ways secure video
pipelines are done, so leaving these checks up to the individual
drivers that implement secure video decode may be more pragmatic. If
there's a generic V4L2 _CID_SECURE_MODE control, that makes it more
general for how drivers can handle secure video decode.
