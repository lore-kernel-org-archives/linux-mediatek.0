Hi Heiko,

There are 4 clocks which are derived from clk_null directly in current
topckgen implementation:

	clkph_mck_o, dpi_ck, usb_syspll_125m, hdmitx_dig_cts

Our designer mentioned 2 things about external clocks:

1. These 4 clocks come from analog macro, not from PLL, nor from
external clocks directly.

2. MT8173 only has 2 external clocks: 26M and 32K.

Analog macro may refer to 26M or other clocks to generate clocks with
specified frequency. But we don't know and don't care how they generate
these clocks. So we want to use a dummy clock to be the root of these 4
clocks.


Hi Sascha,

Do you have any suggestion on clk_null?


Best regards,

James
