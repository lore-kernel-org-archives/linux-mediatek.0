Right, that's the goal of mute_stream() too - it's the last thing we do
during startup and first thing we do on tear down so that there's less
chance of any noise making its way out of the DAI.  If it doesn't work
for your system it's fine to do this though.

In current designs...

You should at least complain somewhere if you get an interrupt that the
driver doesn't know how to handle.

Well, that's kind of the goal in a way - if what's going wrong is
something that's just going to keep flagging the interrupt up then
the system will just get stuck handling the interrupt constantly which
is especially nasty if the interrupt is just silently acknowledged.  If
you return IRQ_NONE eventually the core will decide that the interrupt
is stuck and disable it which contains whatever the problem is.  I'd at
least put some logging in there so if something goes wrong there's an
obvious indication that something's gone wrong with the interrupt.
