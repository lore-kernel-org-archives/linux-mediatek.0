You don't mean sched clock, you just mean a clock_event_device.

A sched_clock is a high-precision clocksource that is read from (which
by definition requires the CPUs to be non-idle). It doesn't have
anything to do with interrupts and therefore cannot wake devices from
idle.

While the clock_event_device for the generic timer can't necessarily
wake CPUs from idle. The generic timer system counter counts even if
CPUs are idle, so the generic timer is fine as a sched_clock. 

Thanks,
Mark.
