If you've got meaningful boot time numbers from practical systems it'd
be good to share them, nobody was able to show any actual problem there.

There's that and also general fragility when multiple drivers interact -
it can get really problematic when different systems end up with
different requirements for the sasme driver and disrupt each other or
conflict with each other.

The reason the regulator drivers are earlier is that cpufreq and a
couple of other things are broken and don't use the device model so we
have to use link order hacks.  I'm pushing any driver that doesn't
specifically have problems with those to just use normal initcall.

Some of the infrastructure here is really trivial if we are saying that
basically all drivers do this.  That way you don't end up so much with
things like wondering why different drivers made different decisions so
much.
