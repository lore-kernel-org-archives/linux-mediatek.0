Nope, I'm planning on getting rid of it in v3.

Yeah I agree, I think the panthor_devfreq initialisation should happen
within panthor_devfreq. It's independent of registering the actual
devfreq device.

I'll note that down as something I will refactor. Once that's done,
I'll have a clearer picture of whether moving the driver out of
panthor is feasible.

Thanks! Don't worry, this is in no rush to be merged, since mainline
still doesn't have everything to boot on this platform, so we're not
in a hurry to get GPU enablement done I don't think. The important
part is getting this right in a way where panthor doesn't carry my
technical debt for years to come, so I'm grateful for the reviews.

Kind regards,
