I assume that I use "generic-ahci" driver directly, and this driver has
no way to handle resets, so I sent this patch.

However, also as far as I look, some hardware-specific drivers handle their 
own resets, and call ahci_platform_{enable,disable}_resources(). 
Surely there are paths to call reset control twice in such drivers.

Identically, when the driver also handle their own clocks, they have same issue.

Since it's difficult to write the resets in general with ahci_platform, I can prepare
hardware-specific driver for our SoCs.

I'm about to use the generic driver, and prepare our phy driver and
DT bindings for our SoCs, but not yet.

Then it's no problem that we can back this out.

Thank you,
