Ack, I understand. Your case here is really not different from all
others. Interface is different, hardware is different, but the concept -
you place votes via some intermediary - is completely the same which
qcom is doing since years and maybe other vendors as well.

And I expect more and more of this in case of Mediatek, so in the future
you will be plcing votes not only for on/off but also for values.
Everyone goes there, mobile, automotive... maybe IoT lags behind because
performance there is not that important, but all others need top
performance with top energy saving which they cannot do in Linux and
they move it to firmware (SCMI, hw voter, dedicated blocks, whatever).

You need to start designing this proper with that future in mind and
syscon is a strong no-go. Whether this is clocks, power domains or
interconnects - dunno yet, maybe both.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
