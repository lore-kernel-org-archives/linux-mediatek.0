The reason why the drm driver matches against the mmsys node in the
first place is that we wanted to avoid 2).
Also, mmsys is not a pure clock controller, as it also contains the
display path configuration in its register space.

Or we could leave the bindings untouched and create one platform device
from the other or even set up the clocks from the drm driver?
