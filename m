Because the "display-subsystem" node does not represent a real device,
it's just there to probe the driver that stitches all the DISP
components together.

All devices in the 0x14000000 - 0x14ffffff memory range are part of the
MMSYS system. That includes the MMSYS control or system configuration
block at 0x14000000 - 0x14000fff as well as all the related MDP (media
data path) and DISP (display data path) blocks that follow. The DISP
blocks are purely display related, while the MDP blocks implement
implement mem2mem functions like scaling and conversion.

The MMSYS control block provides clocks for the DISP (display data path)
and MDP (multimedia data path) blocks, as well as the routing between
them, but not to anything outside of the MMSYS system.
