The 2 memif are "DAI" and "MOD_DAI", designed for speech cases, and they
should be only connected to corresponding external interface "DAI/BT"
and "modem", respectively. We don't need to put them into dynamic
allocation.

Maybe in DPCM, they can be "widgets", and we can define "routes" and
corresponding controls for them.
