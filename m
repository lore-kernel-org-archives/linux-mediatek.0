This BAR0 is a 64-bit memory BAR, the HW default values for this BAR is
0xffff_ffff_0000_0000 and it could not be changed except by config write
operation.

The calculated BAR size will be 0 in 32-bit platform since the
phys_addr_t is a 32bit value in 32-bit platform.

Actually MediaTek's HW does not using this BAR0, just omit it when
assign resource is totally fine.

When assign the resource for each device, software will check the
resource alignment first, and the resource of length zero will be
regarded as a bogus alignment resource, it will be ignored and won't
claim a resource parent for it.

When drivers try to enable the PCIe devices, the software will enable
it's resources, but it will return an error number when found a
unclaimed resource, in that case, the flow of enable devices will be
interrupted and PCIe devices won't work properly.

Thanks.
