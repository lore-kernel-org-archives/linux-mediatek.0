Is it ok to add a prefix of syscon, and name it syscon-usb-wakeup?

It is unthoughtful to put it here;
There is different configuration on platforms, such as on tablet which
only needs line-state wakeup (because system can't enter suspend when
plug in usb cable, so don't need ip-sleep-wakeup to remote wakeup
system), and on box just needs ip-sleep wakeup mode. so it is better to
put in each board's dts.

Yes, you are right.
This confuse me a little before. It was a property of old phy driver at
first, and then ported it here, so did not remove it temp.
After I re-write the phy driver, I will remove it.

Thanks a lot.
