I'm still a little confused how existing code could have worked if
IOMMU has 64K pages and CPU has 4K pages if memory is fragmented.
Presumably existing code in __iommu_dma_alloc_pages() would keep
failing the "alloc_pages(gfp | __GFP_NORETRY, order);" call until
order got down to 0.  Then we'd allocate order 0 (4K) pages and we'd
hit a bug.

Argh.  I see why I was confused and thought it got complicated.  When
I looked at diffs I thought Yong Wu's patch was more complicated
because he rebased it and my diff showed some other unrelated patches.
Dumb.

OK, you're right that this is pretty simple.

In any case, you're right that we should fix this.  ...though assuming
my argument above isn't wrong, then existing code is already broken or
has a latent bug if you've got an IOMMU that can't map at least as
granular as the CPU.  To me that means adding that new feature (or
fixing that latent bug) should be done in a separate patch.  It could
come in sequence either before or after this one.  Of course, if
everyone else thinks it should be one patch I won't block that...
