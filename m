This patchset introduces support for Mediatek High-Speed DMA controller
(MTK-HSDMA) Currently, the driver is already tested successfully with
dmatest module on MT7623 SoC. 

MTK-HSDMA on MT7623 SoC has the single channel which is dedicated to
memory-to-memory transfer through ring-based descriptor management.
Even though there is only one physical channel available inside HSDMA,
the driver is extended to the support for multiple virtual channels
processing simultaneously in round-round way by means of the feature
DMA_VIRTUAL_CHANNELS.
