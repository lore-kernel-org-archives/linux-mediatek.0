Thanks Sascha. If you agree, we prefer to keep v3 layout. It's good to
put all scpsys related code and definitions in the same place (your
driver) and limit the CPU MTCMOS code are all located in button half of
the file. We may also change the function name, for example, rename
spm_cpu_mtcmos_on/off to scpsys_cpu_power_on/off, to make a better
overall sense.
