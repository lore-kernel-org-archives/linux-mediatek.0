Hi, Mark,

Thanks for your info and sorry for late reply. 

I notice ARM ARM said the arch timer shouldn't stop when idle, but
unfortunately that not true for mt8173. The last CPU enter idle can
choose to enter deep idle mode and the counter value would be lost. Our
firmware backup/recover the counter so it looks like it is stopped.

We will change the firmware to add missing count when back from deep
idle to make it looks like the counter never stop.
