Yes, the problem with the ovl nodes is that there are two equivalent
ones. Having two equivalent ipu nodes on i.MX6 was the reason to
introduce the display-subsystem node in the first place, but I'd very
much prefer to avoid it, if possible.

I think the ovl node has no business linking to mmsys_config.
It's the drm driver code that sets up the pipeline, including the crtc
-> encoder connections

I'm already worried about having left out the DISP_PATH0 and DISP_PATH1
multiplexers from my DT graph example. There are so many ways to do this
slightly wrong and then having to live with the stable bindings, that
I'd rather not put an approximation of the real hardware into the device
tree.
Now that I've heard it is acceptable for one driver to look for its
components by their compatible value, I'm leaning towards not describing
the graph in the DT.

Separating the graph out into its own include file would help to make
the main dtsi more readable, though.

Especially for development boards I'd rather keep all possibilites.
Sure, if nothing is connected to the DSIs, disable them and drop thier
possible connections, but I'd still keep ovl0 for example, because it
could be connected to hdmi, even though the driver doesn't support it.
I realize this was probably just an example, so yes, I think this is a
valid method of reducing device tree size for a given board if
necessary.
