I just tried removing the remaining phy_write commands and it still 
seems to work. It seems that the thing that really made this driver not 
work on EcoNet was the EEE which Vladislav Karmanov removed in 
ccbe7540e4aad earlier this month. So at this point I guess I could send 
a patch which does nothing except check MII_ESTATUS & ESTATUS_1000_TFULL 
so it doesn't get confused with the FE driver.


I'm not sure if this is a good plan to deviate from what the vendor code 
was, but the values are not wildly different. If you think it's smart, I 
can send this and we'll see how it goes.


Thanks,

Caleb
