OK, I guess the only reason of "SMI driver select clk driver" is to
avoid runtime error. Maybe this is not necessary since runtime errors
should be guaranteed by defconfig.
Your propose of just remove the select statements is good enough for
this problem, thanks.

Sharp eyes.
As a matter of fact, we are struggling on this problem for the
moment[1], I guess the recently merged device link's patch may help with
this, but I didn't have a change to try that yet.

This have been discussed long times ago, seems the current folder is
where no one object[2][3].
