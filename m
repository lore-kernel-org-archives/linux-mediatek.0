Thanks. I have been through the ABI.txt.

Please note the submitted driver absolutely don't care which of the
five SoCs it is.
In other words, all these SoCs have the same controller.  So its about
have just one compatible right now, and add more if some new SoC comes
with a variation of the controller.
