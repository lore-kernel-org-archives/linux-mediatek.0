Because the series crossed subsystems but didn't apply at the same time.

This is the 1st version I sent before, and the clock parts still under
review :( .  But yes, the 2 inconsistent documents should be fixed -
this may depend on what we end up doing with the DT appearance.

IMHO, apart from overlapping regions with other functions I didn't see
any difference between audsys and other clock drivers (providers).

For the sake of uniformity, I make the 2 sub-devices parallel and move
"simple-mfd" to the top, and the sequences should actually be handled
through "probe deferral mechanism" - that would make this kind of
situations much easier to manage.

BTW, I could make the AFE driver be instantiated/probed from the clock
driver but this seems superfluous to me.  Just make sure is this what
you want?
