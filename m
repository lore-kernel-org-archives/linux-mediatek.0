We already have drivers registering clocks and resets under
drivers/clk, so it's not unheard of. An alternative solution is
to make child devices for the clock part and the reset part at
runtime in the toplevel driver for the vencsys device (don't do
any sort of DT description for this) and use regmap to mediate
the register accesses and locking. That way we can put the clk
driver in drivers/clk/, the reset driver in drivers/reset, etc.
so that logically related code is grouped.
