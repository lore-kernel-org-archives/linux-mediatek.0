"you" == Linux driver, yes.

A power domain ungates power to something.

These are clocks, giving a (x) (M)Hz signal to something.

Okay, now that sounds reasonable, and that sounds like a clear suggestion with
a clear action to take.

Perfect.

Laura, please do exactly that.

P.S.: I understand what you're trying to do here, and I agree; preventing stuff
like this for things that aren't as broken as this is completely right.

My time isn't infinite, either :-)

Indeed - the point is, the only way to make this *broken* thing to work with an
interconnect provider would be to place a software vote to place a vote in the HW
voter, which would be ugly and wrong.

But anyway, a solution was reached. Let's just stop and avoid useless discussions
about what X could be if hardware Y wasn't broken; that'd be just a waste of time.
