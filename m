Please re-read your reply above and my comments and reconsider your
attitude when replying in the future. It's not about whether these
patches go in or not, it's about your wording. And that continues with
aggressively throwing around the term "agro" in two mails already. I
don't see anything aggressive or angry in my original cover letter that
would've prompted your reply and can only interpret that as your own
frustration with your mt7623 progress. Instead you should've taken the
time to explain a bit better what you really meant, then we could've
spared or shortened this lengthy discussion and have a v2 already.

Don't blame _me_ for "bitrot" of a file _you_ added almost a year ago
that did not see any updates since.

Nothing wrong with you not working on something, just don't blame me for
it then, especially when I don't (knowingly) have that hardware and have
never come in touch with it before. I am new to linux-mediatek and had
checked LAKML in vein for any mt7623 patches before sending mine.

The question that I am not in a position to answer is: Are those two
boards identical or just very similar? Paul in CC can hopefully clarify
this when he is back. Matthias as maintainer has also remained silent.

Well, did the _original_ bootloader use 115200? In that case we could
update -evb.dts with it, and you could still override it via console=
for your custom build.

Or maybe having source access you could even contribute to mainline
U-Boot, so we can all work on the same codebase? I read a BPi-R2 is
coming up with mt7623, so booting without appended .dtb and uImage will
come in handy for more people than just EVB owners and Geek Force
backers. I'd happily contribute to making bootefi command work.

OK, will gladly look into the feasibility.

So... 4) add my UART nodes to your -evb.dts? Any nitpicks on the actual
patch 3/4?

You replied to the cover letter 0/4 "i need to NAK this series" - and
series includes all four patches. Therefore my frustration with your
hip-shot reply. If you haven't read the patch, don't NAK it!

In fact still no one replied to it at all, even now that you're aware of
its existence.

See above, please reconsider your tone. Peer review is no excuse for
rude and destructive behavior towards contributors you don't know.

Had you looked at the lists and codebase you would know that I am not
new to FOSS.

And please stop writing "agro", it sounds like some pothead making a
peace sign; not helpful among professional software developers.

Taking the time to start your sentences with a capital letter would also
be a respectful gesture.

> to me it seems suboptimal to support 2 dts files for the same board.

If it is the identical board, then we are in violent agreement. I just
find all your replies to me offensive so far, I don't know you and thus
have no reason to trust your unsubstantiated claims about my board.

Regards,

Andreas
