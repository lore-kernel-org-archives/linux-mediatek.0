Hello Henry,

I believe Mark asked you to use a subject lines reflecting the style
for the subsystem, so the subject should had been something like:

regulators: mt6311: Add DT binding document

I know is in your cover letter, but usually is good to also include a
history log of the changes for each patch so people know what changed.
Everything between the '---' and the diff are omitted by tools like
git am so you can add there.  You can use tools like patman that do
this automatically for you.

Also, I said that you could add my Reviewed-by after the node name
change so you should had carried that. So again:

Reviewed-by: Javier Martinez Canillas <javier@osg.samsung.com>

Best regards,
Javier
