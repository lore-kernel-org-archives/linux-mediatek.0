First node's name will be unique which is guaranteed by IDA framework. If we
have already 2B nodes, then yes, it would be problematic (but 2^31 ought to be
enough :-).

Yes, but in the driver you will have that as child of the device, analogue in DT

  my_root_node { // equal the level of device node you attach it to
	  fixed-link {
	  }
  }

(Sorry, I don't know the DT syntax by heart, but I hope you got the idea.)

To access it will be something like

  child = fwnode_get_named_child_node(fwnode, "fixed-link");

And reading properties, if needed,

  ret = fnode_property_read_...(child, ...);


But this might require to adopt drivers, no? Or I misunderstand the hierarchy.

Okay, grepping the kernel I see this:

	dn = fwnode_get_named_child_node(fwnode, "fixed-link");

This seems the same what you need. I dunno why swnode should be created with
a name for this?

Eliminating an empty root node sounds plausible effect, but the consequences
are not 1:1 mapping of swnodes as it's designed for

  firmware device node		+=	unique root swnode
    property "X"		+=	property "Y"
    child "A"			+=	child "B"

Resulting firmware node as driver sees it:

	device node
		property "X"
		property "Y"
		child "A"
		child "B"

That's all said, I guess the way with a two swnodes (hierarhy) is the correct
one from the beginning.

To the API, now I can tell you how to validate!

Just be sure if there is no name provided, we are just fine. Otherwise
parent _swnode_ should be non-NULL. In such case parent can be only set
either dynamically _or_ statically assigned with a name.
