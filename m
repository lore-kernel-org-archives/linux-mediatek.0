From: George Maraveyas <george.0xfff@gmail.com>

The MT7925 Bluetooth USB function can enumerate successfully after a warm
reboot while the WMT function-control command remains unresponsive.

When that command times out, btmtk_usb_setup() currently returns
-ETIMEDOUT without entering the existing MediaTek reset path. The existing
USB reset and recovery machinery is therefore never reached.

For MT7925, call btmtk_reset_sync() when the WMT function-control command
times out. This enters the existing reset path in btusb_mtk_reset(), which
performs the MediaTek subsystem reset and queues a USB device reset.

Runtime tracing on the affected hardware showed the resulting path through
usb_queue_reset_device(), usb_reset_device() and
usb_reset_and_verify_device(). When reset and verification could not
restore the device, the USB core escalated to a logical disconnect and
re-enumeration.

Recovery succeeded in three controlled Windows-to-Linux tests. Runtime
tracing showed the existing USB reset path escalating to logical disconnect
and re-enumeration. In two of those tests, tracing continued through the
subsequent enumeration failures and directly captured
usb_acpi_port_prr_reset(), after which the MT7925 re-enumerated and
Bluetooth recovered.

These tests were performed on top of Chia-Lin Kao's ACPI _PRR hub patch,
which remains a prerequisite for this patch.

A fourth Windows-to-Linux test was then performed with the diagnostic btusb
blacklist removed and btusb binding normally during boot. The WMT timeout
reproduced and Bluetooth recovered automatically without manual
intervention.

Dear Alan,

Thank you for taking the time to look into my patch and for pointing me
towards the existing reset path. I have now traced the failure on the
affected MT7925 hardware and tested the individual parts separately.

You were correct that a new USB re-enumeration helper is unnecessary.
Once the MT7925 failure is made to enter the existing reset path, I can
see:

  btmtk_reset_sync()
    -> btmtk_usb_subsys_reset()
    -> usb_queue_reset_device()
    -> usb_reset_device()
    -> usb_reset_and_verify_device()

When reset and verification cannot restore the device,
usb_reset_and_verify_device() eventually reaches:

  hub_port_logical_disconnect()

and normal hub re-enumeration follows. I have therefore dropped the
proposed USB helper from v1.

The problem I found is earlier in the Bluetooth path. When MT7925 WMT
FUNC_CTRL times out, btmtk_usb_setup() currently returns -ETIMEDOUT
without entering the existing MediaTek reset machinery. The revised patch
now consists only of the part of my original submission that makes this
timeout enter the existing reset path:

  if (dev_id == 0x7925 && err == -ETIMEDOUT)
          btmtk_reset_sync(hdev);

I tested this both with and without Chia-Lin Kao's _PRR hub patch. I want
to stress that this v2 is based on and dependent on Kao's patch; that
remains the configuration in which I have validated recovery.

Kao's patch alone does not recover this failure because the WMT timeout
never enters the reset path. With the WMT trigger but without Kao's patch,
the reset/disconnect/re-enumeration sequence started, but the device did
not recover in that test.

With Kao's patch plus the WMT trigger, I reproduced and recovered the
Windows-to-Linux failure in three controlled tests. Runtime tracing showed
the existing reset path escalating through usb_queue_reset_device(),
usb_reset_and_verify_device() and hub_port_logical_disconnect(). In two
of those runs, tracing continued through the subsequent enumeration
failures and directly captured:

  usb_acpi_port_prr_reset() <- hub_event.cold

The MT7925 subsequently re-enumerated and Bluetooth recovered.

I then removed the diagnostic btusb blacklist and repeated the test as a
normal Windows-to-Linux restart, allowing btusb to bind automatically.
The WMT command again timed out with -110 and the adapter recovered
without any manual module loading or other intervention.

One behavioural difference is recovery time. The original RFC, which
requested logical disconnect/re-enumeration directly after the MT7925
subsystem reset timed out, recovered Bluetooth in about 71 seconds on
average. Using the existing usb_queue_reset_device() path takes about
133 seconds to complete Bluetooth setup in the current tests, with
successful USB re-enumeration at about 114-115 seconds.

The traces account for most of that difference:
usb_reset_and_verify_device() spends roughly 65 seconds attempting reset
and verification before escalating to hub_port_logical_disconnect(). In
practice this was long enough that, during the first test of the reduced
patch, I almost concluded that recovery had failed and rebooted to start
the test again before the device eventually returned.

I do not think that recovery-time difference justifies retaining the new
USB API, but it seemed worth mentioning because it is a noticeable
behavioural difference between v1 and the reduced approach.

Changes in v2:
- Drop the proposed USB re-enumeration helper.
- Drop the direct MT7925 re-enumeration handling which depended on it.
- Reduce the series from two patches to one Bluetooth patch.
- Retain only the part of the original Bluetooth patch that enters the
  existing reset path on an MT7925 WMT -ETIMEDOUT.
- Keep Chia-Lin Kao's ACPI _PRR hub patch as a prerequisite.
- Add the new runtime trace and recovery results.
- Link to v1: https://patch.msgid.link/20260818-mt7925-rfc-v1-0-284d856ac572@gmail.com

Thanks again for the review.

Kind regards,
George
