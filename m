They are somewhat related, but I don't think this depends on the other series.

This series adds support for wake on mt8183, and makes it similar to,
say, mt8173.

The other patch series fixes issues that affect all mtk pinctrl
variants (i.e. I think mt8173 pinctrl on current mainline has similar
issues). It's not impossible that the answer to the other series is
that we need to refactor code, but in that case, if we merge this
first, we'd just have to clean up one more pinctrl variant.
