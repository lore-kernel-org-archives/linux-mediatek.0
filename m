In [1], "mediatek,mt8183-seninf" use one device to control multiple csi
instance, so it duplicate many register definition. In [2], one
"mediatek,mt2712-mipicsi" device control one csi instance, so there are
multiple device and the register definition does not duplicate. You
recommend adding MT2712 support on top of the MT8183 series, do you mean
that "mediatek,mt2712-mipicsi" should use one device to control multiple
csi instance and duplicate the register setting?
