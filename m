>>> What hardware is this on? If it's SMMUv3 without MSIs (e.g. D05), then you'll still be using the rubbish globally-blocking sync implementation. If that is the case, I'd be very interested to see how much there is to gain from just improving that - I've had a patch kicking around for a while[1] (also on a rebased branch at [2]), but don't have the means for serious performance testing.
I will try your patch to see how much it can improve. I think the best way
to resovle the globally-blocking sync is that the hardware provide 64bits
CONS regitster, so that it can never be wrapped, and the spinlock can also
be removed.

Now that profiling is fairly useful since we got rid of most of the locks, are you able to get an idea of how the overhead in the normal case is distributed between arm_smmu_cmdq_insert_cmd() and __arm_smmu_sync_poll_msi()? We're always trying to improve our understanding of where command-queue-related overheads turn out to be in practice, and there's still potentially room to do nicer things than TLBI_NH_ALL ;)
Even if the software has no overhead, there may still be a problem, because
the smmu need to execute the commands in sequence, especially before
globally-blocking sync has been removed. Base on the actually execute time
of single tlbi and sync, we can get the upper limit in theory.

BTW, I will reply the reset of mail next week. I'm busy with other things now.
