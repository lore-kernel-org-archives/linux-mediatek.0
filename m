A subsystem should be powered on before its clock operations. But I
think this flow should be guaranteed by VENC driver. This patch is
focused on the race between disabling unused clocks and power domains by
frameworks.

One cause of the hang up issue is frameworks' behavior. Power domain
framework and clock framework work independently during kernel init. So
their control flow can't be guaranteed by a suitable driver, such as
VENC driver.

I preferred to keep venc_sel on during VENC power on because I'm not
sure there is any other framework may control VENC's registers during
kernel init.
