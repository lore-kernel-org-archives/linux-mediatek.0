And yet again, I don't have answers to many of those questions... which
just shows how broken this process is, and how utterly pointless it is
0to ask any questions in this area.

My conclusion: you don't care one bit to even answer questions until
there's a chance that patches that you disagree with might be merged,
and oh my god, you've got to respond to stop that happening because you
might disagree with something. You can't do the collaborative thing and
respond when someone asks explicit questions about how things should be
done.

I'm not going to let this go. I'm really pissed off by this and you
are the focus of my frustration.

Well, its now too late to do anything about this. This is going to miss
this cycle. It might get in next cycle, and whoopy do, for a kernel
that's very likely to be a LTS. Given the lack of testing that sounds
like a complete and utter disaster. One that was entirely avoidable had
feedback been given EARLIER in this cycle.
