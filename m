...Yes, but I don't see any patch that is introducing your TB7304F device here.

I strongly suggest you to also send one that achieves basic boot with UART console
as a first step for upstreaming your board, and then go for incremental changes
everytime you get a new feature working.

Generally, if the patches are only simple additions, you could send the original
patches without any author variation (and fixing that MT6392_IRQ_numbers enum
in the original ones because lower case please!) and then your patches on top
with your additions.

Otherwise, if you're "changing a lot of stuff" it makes sense to grab authorship
and add the Co-Developed-by... but I don't think you're changing much, honestly.

Of course, you'll have to drop the TXT additions, as now they are YAML (where the
YAML additions go to a separated dt-bindings patch!).

In the end, it's your choice - that's more or less a gist of how to do it.

The upstream driver just gained support for configuring the display paths
entirely in the devicetree as those are obviously device specific.

You can make use of that for upstreaming your tablet after adding the display
nodes (and bindings, if required) as if you go for the default configuration
that's probably not going to work because it's for the pumpkin boards which
will most probably have a different display pipeline compared to your board.

I did have some issues with an older bootloader on the Xperia M5 smartphone
and would even lock up at boot, because on the old firmwares the power
domains for the CPUs are not managed automatically by FW.

Before discovering that there was new FW (and this stuff is signed so you
cannot cross-flash...) I did engineer a solution, but never upstreamed it
because I did effectively lack time to clean it up and make it proper.

This solution is not upstreamable, as it makes the mtk-pm-domains driver
to be usable only as built-in and not as module anymore... so that would
probably need a separated driver or something like that.

Here's the (rather dirty, but working) code: 
https://gitlab.collabora.com/google/chromeos-kernel/-/commit/ae8f7048aadac03037391a64d9d79ca5af7b7a77

Cheers!
