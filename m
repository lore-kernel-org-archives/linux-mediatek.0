I would tag properly in the next revision.

Yes, I tested with dmatest in multi-thread version.

I would remove it and be more careful about this.

So sorry about this, I misunderstood the usage of reviewed-by tag and I
would remove this. Thanks for pointing out this mistake.

They are different in hardware design.
For example, HSDMA has ring-based descriptor management, while CQDMA only has
one descriptor.

This completion should be redundant and would be removed in the next
revision.

Most of the operations to the CQDMA hardware could be relaxed, and the

This logic would be simplified and the queue would be removed in next revision.

I would re-factor this part for reuse on virt-dma and remove redundant
code.

This logic could be replaced with vchan_find_desc(), and I will fix in
the next revision.

I tested and thought the residue report properly. But after checking the
definition of residue in tx_status again, I found that should be always
return 0 in the driver instead, since there is no state DMA_IN_PROGRESS
or DMA_PAUSED in the driver. I would fix this in the next revision.

I missed desc_completed when I tried to move desc_completed into
mtk_cqdma_free_active_desc, yet this logic should be simplified in the
next revision. The separation on free_active_desc and free_inactive_desc
seems no necessary, and I would merge them and use
vchan_get_all_descriptors only.

Yes, the current implementation should be further simplified and
leverage much more code and routines in vchan layer, I am working on the
next patch and making sure all of them fixed in the next revision.
Thanks for your valuable review and sorry for the misuse on the review
tag,
