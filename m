We as the kernel community develop against master or linux-next. We only 
care about older kernel version in the sense that we intent hard not to 
break any userspace/kernel or firmware/kernel interfaces. Apart from 
that it's up to every individual to backport patches from mainline 
kernel to his respective version. But that's nothing the community as a 
hole can take care of.

Yes please :)

for (j = 0; j < MAX_CLKS... is present in the actual scpsys_probe in 
linux-next (line 485 as of today). This patch moves this for a few lines 
up, to be precise before executing this code sequence:
<code>
pd_data->domains[i] = genpd;
scpd->scp = scp;

scpd->data = data;
</code>

AFAIK there is no reason to do so. It adds unnecessary complexity to the 
patch. So please fix this together with the other comments you got.

Thanks a lot,
Matthias
