Not all usb-b-connector child node need bind this driver, by adding the
new compatible can avoid unnecessary binding.

Yes, the driver, e.g. USB controller driver can do it, but here I want
to provide a common driver to handle this special case, like
extcon-usb-gpio driver does, and try to keep transparency from USB
controller driver.

Ok, will add more description.

Already add them in [1/6].

Here add more constrains for id-gpios and vbus-gpios, at least one
should be present, although they are both optional, this is not true for
some cases, so not suitable to add into usb-connector.txt.

Ok, will drop it.

Ok, got it.

Thanks a lot.
