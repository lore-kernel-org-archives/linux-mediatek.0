Nope.  Logically speaking, the PCI device in question is a Root Port,
which is a bridge between a primary PCI bus (probably bus 0) that is
internal to the Root Complex, and a secondary PCI bus.  This bridge,
like all other PCI-to-PCI bridges, does no address translation.

The Root Complex *also* contains a host bridge from whatever the
upstream CPU bus is and the logical PCI bus 0 internal to the Root
Complex.  This host bridge can perform address translation.

The Root Port PCI device might also have device-specific PCI config
registers, and those might offer some control over the host bridge
part of the Root Complex.  There is probably an MMIO (non-PCI config
space) way to configure the Root Complex, since you may not be able to
access the PCI config space before the Root Complex is configured.

Nope, that's not the way this process works.  You proposed setting
the class code as "a way to make this work".  I did a bunch of
research to figure out the best way of solving this and pointed out
a defect in the PCI core.  Fixing that defect will solve your problem
and possibly others.

The correct next step is for you to make that PCI core change, test it
and make sure it works, and post that as part of your series.  If, in
addition, you want to change the class code of your device, you can
also do that, but that's a secondary, optional step as far as I'm
concerned.
