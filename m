Yeah, changing bindings means that downstream DT files will need updates, which
can be awkward. But it's worth paying attention to moving forward.

Sounds good!

Yeah, I can see how that happens. Also, often the hardware documents don't
aggregate in the same way that our software does, so they won't notice
inconsistencies between versions in the same way (nobody really tries to make
one document with pin names between different chip families on the hardware
side).

Yeah, I can see that benefit, but it can also be caught with our new schemas
and/or by drivers in some cases. Having a binding that's a natural way of
describing the hardware without encoding it tends to be preferred.

You can still have symbols for the pin numbers if you want, but if you build
your header file a bit more elabroate you can easily expose the pin and
function names through sysfs instead, which helps debugging.
