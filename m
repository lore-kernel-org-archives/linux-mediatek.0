Any firmware in linux-firmware that needs a rename will still need to retain
compatibility with old kernel versions: it doesn't matter if scp.img will be
renamed because we will anyway need a symlink.

This does effectively mean that, for MT8188, the current "scp.img" will be
"reachable" as both "scp.img" and as "scp_c0.img" - so timing for removal of
the firmware-name property in here doesn't matter at all.

There's no rush.

We can avoid autosel with that, sure - but I still don't really judge it as being
a fix, as not specifying firmware-name is something new, even if it was technically
wrong from the beginning.
(Someone may or may not agree with me, but that's another story.)

In the past, it wasn't a problem - it's a problem now, and a resolved one - but
this doesn't mean that having this property was a "broken" behavior in the past.

It worked. And it was fine.

Even if I don't see the actual benefit, I don't mind having this backported to
v6.18 when it'll be time to pick this commit along with the others, but again
I don't understand why you're feeling like this is urgent.

For how I see it: -> it's not urgent! <-

There has to be no regression on the supported boards - with or without - this
property being present.

The only one that can be just renamed without *caring* about symlinks is MT8189,
as it "never worked" upstream (as in, there, a rename without a symlink will not
create any regression) simply because MT8189 never got any firmware-name property
(actually, never got any devicetree at all, even).

Again, timing is not important; the sooner the better, yes, but at the same level
of importance as any other *functionality improvement* (not fixes), nothing more
and nothing less.

Does that clarify the course of action for you?

Angelo
