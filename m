The kernel doesn't need to match the compatible since the MFD driver
register the device explicitly with mfd_add_devices().

In fact, the kernel is currently not matching the compatible, it is
only matching because you provided a .of_compatible is provided in the
mfd_cell.

If you wan't subdevices for a MFD to be registered automatically by OF
and the compatible matched like other buses, then your MFD driver
needs to call of_platform_populate() instead mfd_add_devices().
