The Audio DSP is a Tensilica HiFi-5 DSP, and it's a block that is - hardware
speaking - separated from the rest of the Audio interfaces of the SoC.

The whole sound subsystem can work either with or without the DSP, in the sense
that the DSP itself can remain unpowered and completely unconfigured if its
functionality is not desired - hence, this is a board specific configuration:
if the board wants to use the DSP, we use the DSP - otherwise, we just don't.

Regarding the two "platforms", in short:
"mediatek,platform" -> Audio Front End (AFE)
"mediatek,adsp" -> Audio DSP

Now, you can either link the AFE DAIs to the I2S

As for "mediatek,platform" - that's used to link the Analog Front End (AFE) as
the DAI Link platform (so the path is direct to/from DL/UL DAIs to AFE) or the
ADSP one as the DAI Link platform (so that the path is to/from DL/UL DAIs to
DSP to AFE), but that - of course - still requires an AFE, otherwise you cannot
get the audio out of the speakers or in from the mic anyway.

Yes, this is used for exactly that... but I believe that we can deprecate this
now that we have support for the "standard" `audio-routing` property and for the
DAI Link nodes (examples that you can find in current device trees are mm-dai-link,
hs-playback-dai-link, or any other subnode of the sound card).

Specifically, those subnodes *do* require a "link-name" property, which *does*
effectively contain the same DAI Link names as the ones that are inside of the
"mediatek,dai-link" property.

On MT8195, you can find both the subnodes and the mediatek,dai-link - yes - but
that was done to retain compatibility of the device tree with old drivers (so,
an unusual case of new device tree on old kernel).

Finally, I believe that we can avoid adding that "mediatek,dai-link" property
to the MT8188 binding, and rely on:
  1. Whatever is provided in struct snd_soc_card for that device; and
  2. Whatever is provided in device trees as dai link subnodes, which would
     restrict N.1 as that's anyway describing card prelinks.

Angelo
