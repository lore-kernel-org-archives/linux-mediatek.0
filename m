Not all IOMMUs need Local Arbiters... some of them are very specific and do not
need to be arbitered, mostly because they're not shared.

Some.. like the infra contexts for the PCI-Express controller... because then
generally all of the multimedia related contexts should need the arbitering
because they should be all shared between the multimedia IPs (but it may also
be possible to use some without arbitering, depending on the application, though
upstream I think there's no multimedia context with no arbiter - I didn't really
carefully check in devicetrees anyway).

That's true and I completely agree with you, in general - though, this is a "Local
Arbiter" and... if there's nothing to arbiter, it's not functional.

This is arbitering iommu-bus/memory(dma)-bus access to provide some kind of basic
bus QoS: of course, if there's no iommu, there can't be any access, so again there
would be nothing to perform bandwidth arbitration with.

Count that we will (hopefully...) (and hopefully soon...) see some interconnect
driver that takes the defaults in SMI (in a way or another) and changes them to
provide a finer grain QoS (because right now it's static, there's no usage analysis
in place), so the amount of users of mtk-smi should also get higher.. maybe.

Cheers,
Angelo
