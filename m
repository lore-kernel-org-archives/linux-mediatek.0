So what you're trying to do here is not so much set a specific mode as
set maximum regulation accuracy for a period of time.

Well, we want a coherent general use case that doesn't require a user to
know the specific details of the regulator they're working with since we
need to hide that knowledge from the user.

I'm not sure I really understand these distinctions to be honest,
and specifying minimum loads seems very tricky from a robustness point
of view.

If all you need right now is a way to maximize regulation quality that's
probably a lot easier than anything based on absolute loads or on
multiple "normal operation" modes - it takes a lot of the complexity out
of things as there's no need to consider things like the distinctions
between modes.  We just need a standard operating mode and to know the
highest available mode.  I'm not sure exactly how to do that as an API
though, let me think about it...  your use case isn't one I'd come
across before.

More common use cases are around manually doing adaptive mode switching
for regulators that are poor at automatically adjusting performance and
handling of very low standby current situations where the adaption can
consume enough power to register.
