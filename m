We can get cmdq dev from mailbox controller,
so we don't need mediatek,gce anymore.

As you know, the maximum number of gce threads is 16.
However, we plan to support more clients in the future,
and they may need to use more than 16 gce threads.

For this issue, our plan is to let multiple clients share the same gce
thread; i.e. we will acquire gce thread for client dynamically by
internal policy in cmdq driver.
Unfortunately. mailbox channel has exclusive feature.
Quote from comment of mbox_request_channel().
"The channel is exclusively allocated and can't be used by another
client before the owner calls mbox_free_channel."
Therefore, we plan to remove mailbox framework from cmdq driver in the
future.

For current status, could you tell us your preference?
(1) Move cmdq to mailbox folder and then move it back here when we
submit another patch to support more than 16 gce clients; or
(2) Remove mailbox framework from cmdq now for its future extensibility.

Thanks,
HS
