I was using the v1.1 RC parameters before, but Nikolai found out that some panels
actually require that, even when v1.2 support is not declared.

Besides, he also validated that v1.2 works for him, and works for me as well, so
I opted to use those ones instead, as the v1.1 pre_scr params were working for me
but not for him.

This will be improved in the future, as choosing any of the two will leave us with
something working and something broken... but I plan to make those improvements
only after at least this basic support finds his way upstream.

Cheers,
Angelo
