Yes. That is what the datasheets say, but read down there.

Also yes.

We discussed about aggregating votes, yes, in software - this instead is a
*broken* hardware that does the aggregation internally and does not require
nor want external drivers to do the aggregation.

Being it fundamentally *broken*, this being a voting system is what the hardware
initially wanted to be - but effectively, since it requires YOU to:
  - Make sure that power supplies are turned on, if not, turn them on by "touching"
    HW registers (so, without any assistance from the voter MCU), if any;
  - Turn on parent clocks manually, if any, before using the "voter mcu" to try
    to ungate that clock; and
    - Enable the "FENC" manually, after the mcu says that the clock was ungated.

in the current state, it is just an hardware managed refcounting system and
nothing else, because the MCU seems to be unfinished, hence, again, b r o k e n.

Note that by "manually" I always mean "with direct writes to a clock controller's
registerS, and without any automation/assistance from the HWV MCU".

We're using the "hardware-voter" name because this is how MediaTek calls it in the
datasheets, and no it doesn't really *deserve* that name for what it is exactly in
MT8196 and MT6991.

And mind you - if using the "interconnect" property for this means that we have to
add an interconnect driver for it, no, we will not do that, as placing a software
vote that votes clocks in a a voter MCU that does exactly what the interconnect
driver would do - then requiring virtual/fake clocks - is not a good solution.

So, what should we do then?

Change it to "mediatek,clock-hw-refcounter", and adding a comment to the binding
saying that this is called "Hardware Voter (HWV)" in the datasheets?

Or is using the "interconnect" property without any driver in the interconnect API
actually legit? - Because to me it doesn't look like being legit (and if it is, it
shouldn't be, as I'm sure that everyone would expect an interconnect API driver
when encountering an "interconnect" property in DT), and if so, we should just add
a new "hw-interconnect" or "interconnect-hw" instead to not create confusion.

Angelo
