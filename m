That is a recent addition, since the argument was made that when using
a 1000base-X fibre transceiver, using ethtool to disable autoneg is a
reasonable thing to do - and something that was supported with
mvneta_ethtool_set_link_ksettings() as it stands at the point in the
commit above.

I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at there.

Going back to the mvneta combined PCS+MAC implementation, we read the
link parameters from the PCS when operating in in-band mode and throw
them at the fixed PHY so that ethtool works, along with all the usual
link up/down state reporting, carrier etc.

If autoneg is disabled, then we effectively operate in fixed-link mode
(use_inband_status becomes false, and we start forcing the link up/down
and also force the speed and duplex parameters by disabling autoneg.)

Note that this version of mvneta does not support 1000base-X mode, only
SGMII is actually supported.

There's a few things that are rather confusing in the driver:

MVNETA_GMAC_INBAND_AN_ENABLE - this controls whether in-band negotiation
is performed or not.
MVNETA_GMAC_AN_SPEED_EN - this controls whether the result of in-band
negotiation for speed is used, or the manually programmed speed in this
register.
MVNETA_GMAC_AN_DUPLEX_EN - same for duplex.
MVNETA_GMAC_AN_FLOW_CTRL_EN - same for pause (only symmetric pause is
supported)

MVNETA_GMAC2_INBAND_AN_ENABLE - misnamed, it selects whether SGMII (set)
or 1000base-X (unset) format for the 16-bit control word is used.

There is another bit in MVNETA_GMAC_CTRL_0 that selects between
1000base-X and SGMII operation mode, and when this bit is set for
1000base-X. This version of the driver doesn't support 1000base-X,
so this bit is never set.
