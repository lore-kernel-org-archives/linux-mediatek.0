This series add the initial support for the Airoha AN8855 Switch.

It's a 5 port Gigabit Switch with SGMII/HSGMII upstream port.

This is starting to get in the wild and there are already some router
having this switch chip.

It's conceptually similar to mediatek switch but register and bits
are different. And there is massive list of register for the PCS
configuration.
Saddly for that part we have absolutely NO documentation currently.

There is this special thing where PHY needs to be calibrated with values
from the switch efuse. (the thing have a whole cpu timer and MCU)

Given the double usage of PHY and Switch accessor, a special handling
is used with registering a mdio-regmap bus for each internal PHY.

From v8 Driver is now evaluated with Kernel selftest scripts for DSA:

Additional info about the test bridge_vlan_aware.sh.

It was discovered that the Airoha Switch (and probably the Mediatek one
that produce the same test results) hardcode checking for 802.1ad when
the port is configured in VLAN-Aware mode (aka Security mode).

In such mode, both 802.1q and 802.1ad TPID are checked, hence the
bridge_vlan_aware.sh test fails as packets with 802.1ad TPID are rejected
(in the case where a wrong VLAN ID is forwarded)

This was confirmed by Airoha and multiple try were done to try to
workaround this problem. No solution were found to this as ACL mechanism
can't work on receiving packets and the Switch doesn't support turning off
this.

The current driver is in use from 4 month on OpenWrt with all kind of
scenario confirming working in VLAN bridge. By tweaking the
bridge_vlan_aware.sh test with setting the TPID to 0x9100, the test
correctly pass as packets gets classified as untagged and the default PVID
applied. It's also confirmed that switch correctly parse the 802.1ad tag
and make the packet pass only when allowed by VLAN table rules.

Changes v17:
- Drop nvmem patch (subset merged and present in linux-next)
- Fix wrong Documentation patch for MFD
- Address reviews for MFD driver
- Rework MTK tag to slipt for Airoha name
Changes v16:
- Rebase on top of net-next
- Drop PBUS implementation (Airoha said that it's not OK to use it)
- Convert to simple mdio-regmap and split regmap
- Fix typo for some define (AND8855 -> AN8855)
Changes v15:
- Rebase on top of net-next
- Drop regmap MDIO patch (in favor of PBUS)
- Implement MDIO PBUS and rework MDIO driver/MFD
- Reimplement EEE support
- Add some check for regmap from MFD
- Move to single regmap and add comments with all findings
Changes v14:
- Move MAITAINERS entry to dedicated commit (make it easier for cross
  subsystem merge)
- Pack variables in trap function
- Add additional patch for reported difference from MTK tag
Changes v13:
- Reimplement tx_lpi OPs
- Rework mdio-regmap to internally encode/decode address
- Fix error in Documentation

- Fix comments from Lee on MFD driver
- Improve print error and drop extra space in DSA driver
Changes v12:
- Update on top of net-next
- Add additional info on conver-letter about slefttests and HW limitation
- Introduce mdio-regmap generalization for multiple address
- Drop dev flags and define PHY calibration in PHY node directly
Changes v11:
- Address reviews from Christophe (spell mistake + dev_err_probe)
- Fix kconfig dependency for MFD driver (depends on MDIO_DEVICE instead of MDIO)
  (indirectly fix link error for mdio APIs)
- Fix copy-paste error for MFD driver of_table
- Fix compilation error for PHY (move NVMEM to .config)
- Drop unneeded NVMEM node from MDIO example schema (from Andrew)
- Adapt MFD example schema to MDIO reg property restrictions
Changes v10:
- Entire rework to MFD + split to MDIO, EFUSE, SWITCH separate drivers
- Drop EEE OPs (while Russell finish RFC for EEE changes)
- Use new pcs_inpand OPs
- Drop AN restart function and move to pcs_config
- Enable assisted_learning and disable CPU learn (preparation for fdb_isolation)
- Move EFUSE read in Internal PHY driver to .config to handle EPROBE_DEFER
  (needed now that NVMEM driver is register externally instead of internally to switch
   node)
Changes v9:
- Error out on using 5G speed as currently not supported
- Add missing MAC_2500FD in phylink mac_capabilities
- Add comment and improve if condition for an8855_phylink_mac_config

- Add devm_dsa_register_switch() patch
- Add Reviewed-by tag for DT patch
Changes v4:
- Set regmap readable_table static (mute compilation warning)
- Add support for port_bridge flags (LEARNING, FLOOD)
- Reset fdb struct in fdb_dump
- Drop support_asym_pause in port_enable
- Add define for get_phy_flags
- Fix bug for port not inititially part of a bridge
  (in an8855_setup the port matrix was always cleared but
   the CPU port was never initially added)
- Disable learning and flood for user port by default
- Set CPU port to flood and learning by default
- Correctly AND force duplex and flow control in an8855_phylink_mac_link_up
- Drop RGMII from pcs_config
