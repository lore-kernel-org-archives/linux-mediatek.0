So in your case you might be able to remove the reset handling
from the ahci_st driver and rely on the new libahci_platform
handling instead? If that works that seems like a win to me.

As said elsewhere in this thread I think it makes sense to keep (or re-add
after a revert) the libahci_platform reset code, but make it conditional
on a flag passed to ahci_platform_get_resources(). This way we get
the shared code for most cases and platforms which need special handling
can opt-out.

Hans
