great to hear that this should work for most devices!

I see, thank you for explaining this!

what do you think about replacing the two following fields from struct usb_hcd:
  struct usb_phy *usb_phy;
  struct phy *phy;
with:
  /*
   * do not manage the PHY state in the HCD core, instead let the driver handle
   * this (for example if the PHY can only be turned on after a specific event)
   */
  bool skip_phy_initialization;

maybe I should also do this together with my other series which adds
the PHY wrapper to the HCD core (or even as a separate series, which
would be merged before this and the PHY wrapper series). what do you
think?

Martin
