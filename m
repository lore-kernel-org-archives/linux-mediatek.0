Indeed, but I prefer this style which clearly separates the error path
from the success path while making the success return value explicit.

Why do you think so? You still need to retrieve the regulator from the
driver data. Sure, this could be folded into mtk_set_power(), but that
would be less ideal if there are more resources that need to be managed
(e.g. an external lna supply).
