is_vmalloc_or_module_addr() already works properly: modules are loaded
into their own dedicated region, or in the vmalloc space otherwise.
Note that this even applies when disregarding KASRL: the module PLT
support uses the vmalloc region as overflow if the module region is
exhausted.

I agree it may be misleading if the module region is empty while
modules have been loaded. But let's not conflate the module *region*
with the actual locations where modules are loaded: without
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MODULE_REGION_FULL=y, this is a 128 MB region that
overlaps the kernel .text section.
