Can't we call
         clk_disable_unprepare(cmdq->clock);
         cmdq_task_release(task);
after invoking the callback?
Regrading the clock, wouldn't it be easier to handle the clock 
enable/disable depending on the state of task_busy_list? I suppose we 
can't as we would need to check the task_busy_list of all threads, right?
