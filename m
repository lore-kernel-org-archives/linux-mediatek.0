Ouch. Well, it's mostly done then, hopefully sooner than later :-)

Okay, almost done there too, then.

Start upstreaming the RTC (and MFD parts) right now maybe?
That all depends on the actual state of things, of course.

Remember that you can upstream whatever is clean and works fine, that doesn't
have hard dependencies on other components.

The power domains should be handled by mtk-pm-domains.c - not sure what you wrote
but if you did it on mtk-scpsys.c that's wrong.

I can confirm that the MSDC controller in MT6589 will work with mtk-sd, there may
be some very small modifications to be done.... if any.
The mtk-sd driver does support "very old" SoCs already :-)

I can suggest to try host mode. Usually that's the one that easily wants to work.
That may help you to validate that the PHY is actually working.

UART DMA on smartphones and tablets is usually used by Bluetooth, but if your
device does not have any UART DMA device, you will be unable to validate.

Soldering a UART for the console won't help you to validate UART DMA, as the
one you select for that excludes DMA.

For SPI and I2C, the IPs didn't really change all that much from the old era
to MT6795/MT8173, so I'm confident that you won't have any problem with the
IP driver itself (be it SPI or I2C).

I really appreciate seeing those old devices getting new life with upstream,
as much as seeing new ones upstreamed. That's really nice.

Keep up the good work!

Cheers,
Angelo
