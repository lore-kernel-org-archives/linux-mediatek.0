Sorry for late reply.

As you said in "[RFC,v4,3/6]i2c: add docs to clarify DMA handling". Most
i2c_msgs are register accesses and thus, small messages. And
"[RFC,v4,4/6] i2c: sh_mobile: use helper to decide if DMA is useful".

Maybe the solution as below will be better. Other drivers which will use
i2c would not have to make buffer DMA safe especially register
accesses(they like to use local variables when data_len = 1 or 2).

solution:
2. use FIFO mode when length<=fifo_depth(mtk i2c fifo_depth=8), use
the flag "I2C_M_DMA_SAFE" to check buffer for DMA mode when
length>fifo_depth in i2c-mt65xx.c .

Thanks.
