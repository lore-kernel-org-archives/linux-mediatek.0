I'm telling that *more* than one free stack and also tags per object can be stored.
If object reused we would still have information about n-last usages of the object.
It seems like much easier and more efficient solution than patch you proposing.

As for other concern about this particular patch
 - It wasn't tested. There is deadlock (sleep in atomic) on the report path which would have been noticed it tested.
   Also GFP_NOWAIT allocation which fails very noisy and very often, especially in memory constraint enviromnent where tag-based KASAN supposed to be used.

 - Inefficient usage of memory:
	48 bytes (sizeof (qlist_object) + sizeof(kasan_alloc_meta)) per kfree() call seems like a lot. It could be less.

	The same 'struct kasan_track' stored twice in two different places (in object and in quarantine).
	Basically, at least some part of the quarantine always duplicates information that we already know about
	recently freed object. 

	Since now we call kmalloc() from kfree() path, every unique kfree() stacktrace now generates additional unique stacktrace that
	takes space in stackdepot.
