bool is _Bool in the kernel (see include/linux/types.h). So whenever you
see a bool in the kernel you can assume it's either 0 or 1. Are there
any cases where this conveniently simple rule doesn't hold?

But here the discussion is moot, because as you say, the function will
only be passed false or true so we know "enable" is either 0 or 1 and
double negating will do nothing.

So you should not, as it's confusing at best.

Thanks,
