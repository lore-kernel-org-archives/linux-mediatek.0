Hi Mark,

Thanks for responding.

It's not just noisy, it also adds to boot time.

What problems?
More patches as people adjust / tune / optimize boot time, or something else?

For regulators, I think things are a bit more subtle.  Most regulators
are external components that can be used on different boards for
different purposes, so I can see an argument for treating them in a
more generic way by using a later device_initcall.  The exception
being architecture specific PMICs that only make sense when paired
with a specific small set of CPUs - and if you look, there are many
PMIC regulator drivers that are at earlier initcall levels, presumably
because they are required by cpufreq drivers, and/or their initcall
level is set as the same as the rest of the functions exposed by the
same PMIC MFD.

Glad to hear it is a well recognized problem, and that people plan to
look into a fix.

Nothing above sounds like a reason not to merge this patch, however.
Why should we block useful patches that use existing tools to fix real
architecture-specific issues until new infrastructure is merged that
solves general problems?
