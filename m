Long story short: we do need to create platform devices out of static
table (eg ARM64 IORT) entries. Current code parses the table entries and
try to map the devices IRQs (ie acpi_register_gsi()) when the platform
device is created. Now, the interrupt controller that device IRQ's is
routed to might not have probed yet. We have to defer probing and later,
when the platform driver probes, map the IRQ.

Issue is: for OF nodes and ACPI devices, behind the platform device
firmware node there is a standard firmware object, so implementing
fwnode_irq_get() is trivial. For the devices I am talking about,
the data providing GSI info (hwirq, trigger/polarity) is static
table specific, so the idea was to stash that data and embed it in
fwnode_static along with a irq_get() fwnode_operations function
specific to that piece of data so that device drivers can actually do:

fwnode_irq_get()

on the fwnode _seamlessly_ (if you still do wonder: those platform
devices created out of static table entries in ACPI in OF are
of_node(s)).

There is a less convoluted solution (that is what some platform
drivers in ACPI do today), that is, we pass the static table
data in pdev->dev.platform_data and each platform_driver parses it differently.

That works but that also means the in the respective device drivers
OF and ACPI IRQ (and MMIO) parsing differ (which is not necessarily
a problem I just have to rewrite them all).

Now - when it comes to "interrupt-names". Some of the device drivers
I mention do:

eg platform_get_irq_byname_optional()

that expects the IRQ to be mapped and stored in a named platform device resource.

That's easy in DT - for two reasons:

(1) "interrupt-names"
(2) standard properties behind the of_node

how to do that for fwnodes that aren't backed by either OF nodes or ACPI
devices (that do use "interrupt-names" _DSD property) is a question.

Mind, the "interrupt-names" thing is a detail in the whole mechanism.

DT overlays to represent in ACPI those static table entries ?

I vividly remember the days ACPI for ARM64 was being merged - that's what
our crystal ball predicted :)

This delayed IRQ mapping notwithstanding, I read what you wrote and took
note. The worry is, this fwnode_*() (on ACPI nodes) interface trickling
into subsystems where it should not (ie PCI, clocks, regulators) - hopefully
the respective maintainers are keeping an eye on it.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
