It respects the coding style/standard and I prefer the original version.
It's also easier to debug if you want to add extra code on error.

I would be in favor to keep mtk_set_active. It clearly shows when the
regulator is enabled.
It also seems logic to have an enable/standby function in the driver.
Even if those are trivial (for now).
