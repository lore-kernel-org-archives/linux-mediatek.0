Hi Matthias,

Appreciate your help on reviewing. Add my comments inline

I will add more description for why changing binding here in the commit
message of the patch. 

"mediatek,mt7623-evb" can be safely changed to
"mediatek,mt7623n-rfb-nand" because real users can't get the board that
is a kind of debug board internally in Mediatek. Instead We should add
more specific board variants as the adding here to let people easily
know what board they uses. 

The similar description is done as (2/9) arm: dts: mt7623: rename
mt7623-evb.dts to arch/arm/boot/dts/mt7623n-rfb.dtsi that states
" Additionally Mediatek pointed out, that the EVB is yet another board
and the board in question is infact the RFB. Take this into account
while renaming the files." 

However I didn't make similar sufficient statements into the patch when
I split from the last version of the patch. Sorry:(

Okay. thanks for the suggestion:) 
I will reorder them to help direct them to the part they're interested
in.
