Ok, I think I get it now. The device_links that get created are
enforcing a probe order dependency, but in cases where this driver
probes before those device links are even created, then this extra
check defers so that the probe order stays correct. Then the
device_links were correct to WARN because they're basically saying,
"hey, you asked us to enforce a particular dependency, but I can
already see probe is happening in an order that violates that
dependency".

Is that right?
