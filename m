I think using the chip name as in the first version of your patch name is
better then, in particular since the 'gen2v1' would not be an actual version
number but just say which variant got merged into mainline first.

A related question would be on how general we want the binding to be.
Your binding text starts out by describing that there are three root ports
and what their capabilities are.

If you think there might be other (existing or future) chips that use the
same binding and driver, then being a little more abstract could help
in the long run.
