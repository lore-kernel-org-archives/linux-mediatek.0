I think I know what's going on.

This is just mediatek-drm calling the ddp_start() callback, which is needed to
start enabling the DSI, but putting the lane_ready(), hs_mode() calls in the
mtk_dsi_poweron() function is wrong, because that's enabling the HS clock way
before DRM bridge callbacks are executed.

I said multiple times that I wanted to remove that ddp_start() and ddp_stop()
nonsense from mediatek-drm, and I think if what I think is happening is what
is actually happening, I have one more reason to clean up that .. stuff (more
than what I've just done with my more-than-50-commits of cleanup).

Adam, one more test please. That's not shotgunning, and I'm fairly confident
that this is going to work.
