I don't understand this part. Why do you need a static translation for these?
Shouldn't they just be listed in the 'reg' property of the parent node now that
you have the clk/reset/phy properties in the parent as well?

Child nodes do not normally have interrupt-map properties. Isn't this
already covered by the interrupt-map in the parent?
