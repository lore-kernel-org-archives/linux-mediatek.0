Hi Greg, 

This is v3 patchset for the leftover 2 patches for nvmem regmap
removal series [1]. These patches are based on char-misc tree.

nvmem uses regmap_raw_read/write apis to read/write data from providers,
With recent patch 922a9f936e40 ("regmap: mmio: Convert to regmap_bus
and fix accessor usage") nvmem providers based on regmap-mmio stopped
working, as nvmem core was using raw accessors.
This issue can be fixed temporarly by moving to other regmap apis,
but we might hit same issue in future, and regmap looks like an
overdo for nvmem. Moving to interfaces based on read/write callbacks
from providers would be more robust.

This patchset converts the nvmem core and nvmem provider drivers to
use the new callbacks. Tested this patchset on qfprom and at24 drivers.
Other driver are only compile tested, any testing on them would be great.

Most of the patches have been applied to char-misc tree, these are the
two patches which had some outstanding comments on mxs nvmemprovider,
which are now fixed.

Changes since v2:
 - Fixed the mxs size and dt data pointer spotted by Stefan and Fabio

Changes since v1:
 - rebased mtk-efuse on top of char-misc
 - addressed concerns raised by Stefan Wahren.
