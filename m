Things are actively broken right now, in the sense that there are many
needless probe deferrals on boot.
These are pinctrl drivers, which are required to load before every
other driver that requests a gpio.
AFAICT, the pinctrl is part of the platform "architecture", hence why
I suggest we move this to arch_initcall().
arch_initcall() is also consistent with 39 other pinctrl drivers in
drivers/pinctrl.
19 others use subsys_initcall(), core_initcall() or
postcore_initcall(), any of which would also work.
