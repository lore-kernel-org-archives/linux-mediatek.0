Agreed. We should only use quirks if the current (architecturally
compliant) code causes real issues with the hardware. Then the quirk can
be used to either avoid the problematic routines or to take extra steps
to make things work as the architecture intended.

I've asked how this IOMMU differs from the architecture on a number of
occasions, but I'm still yet to receive a response other than "it's special".
