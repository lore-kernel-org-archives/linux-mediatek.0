I'm not disputing whether the choice of dma_dev is semantically 
appropriate, I'm just saying that the method of pulling a struct device 
reference out of the DT topology shows no *obvious* guarantee that that 
specific device will have a driver bound and be validly configured 
before that dma_dev can be used via any other path. Especially when it's 
all happening off the back of another fake device created by the fake 
DRM device itself.

Maybe there's some hidden magic in all the component stuff which makes 
it work out fine, I don't know. This was just an observation since I 
went looking for potential bugs and found something which at first 
glance *looks* rather fragile, compared to, say, if mtk_mdp_rdma's own 
probe() or bind() were to directly set itself as the DMA device.

Ah, that I was not expecting, and it does indeed explain how things get 
into that state.

I had a think about it, and although there's very much a historical mess 
in this area, I'm inclined to agree that we could do better. Patch sent.

Cheers,
Robin.
