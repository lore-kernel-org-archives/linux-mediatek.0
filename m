Eh, that's not possible :-(

Doing that would bring us back to square 1. The SoC will lockup.... ACP is still
trying to constantly prefetch, and the issue here is going totally unpowered, as
explained in the commit description - because that's the HW condition that causes
the stall eventually.

To make things "funnier" (in this case) for everyone, the ACP is always-on, of
course, so there's no cleaner way around it.

Eh for both me and Dmitry the commit message looked clear, but yeah, it's surely
just because we bashed our heads over this issue, and our knowledge makes things
look obvious when they are definitely *not*, as you just pointed out - so thanks
for that!

So yeah, Dmitry, if you can please send a v2 with some more clarification in the
commit message (practically, add the information that I shared in this topic),
that would be awesome.

Yeah, the bootloader is doing random things, leaving the PDs only partially powered
ON (just the SRAM, which is half of the MFG_ASYNC setup, and 2D accelerator, but
not the rest, which makes little sense because there's another parent in the middle
that is not powered at all...) and that's why this issue is experienced.

I think this is really just a bootloader bug in this case, so if we lived in a
parallel universe where the MediaTek kernel drivers supported continuous splash on
upstream... I'm mostly sure that this issue would still be there, and that this SoC
would still randomly and spectacularly freeze without this commit.

Cheers,
Angelo
