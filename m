You may not be surprised to read that this was also our starting point 2
months ago, I had implemented support for standalone PCS very similar to
the approach you have published now, using refcnt'ed instances and
locked wrapper functions for all OPs. My approach, like yours, was to
create a new subsystem for standalone PCS drivers which is orthogonal to
phylink and only requires very few very small changes to phylink itself.
It was a draft and not as complete and well-documented like your series
now, of course.

I've then shared that implementation with Christian and some other
experienced OpenWrt developers and we concluded that having phylink handle
the PCS lifecycle and PCS selection would be the better and more elegant
approach for multiple reasons:
 - The lifetime management of the wrapper instances becomes tricky:
   We would either have to live with them being allocated by the
   MAC-driver (imagine test-case doing unbind and then bind in a loop
   for a while -- we would end up oom). Or we need some kind of garbage
   collecting mechanism which frees the wrapper once refcnt is zero --
   and as .select_pcs would 'get' the PCS (ie. bump refcnt) we'd need a
   'put' equivalent (eg. a .pcs_destroy() OP) in phylink.

   Russell repeatedly pointed me to the possibility of a PCS
   "disappearing" (and potentially "reappearing" some time later), and
   in this case it is unclear who would then ever call pcs_put(), or
   even notify the Ethernet driver or phylink about the PCS now being
   available (again). Using device_link_add(), like it is done in
   pcs-rzn1-miic.c, prevents the worst (ie. use-after-free), but also
   impacts all other netdevs exposed by the same Ethernet driver
   instance, and has a few other rather ugly implications.

 - phylink currently expects .mac_select_pcs to never fail. But we may
   need a mechanism similar to probe deferral in case the PCS is not
   yet available.
   Your series partially solves this in patch 11/11 "of: property: Add
   device link support for PCS", but also that still won't make the link
   come back in case of a PCS showing up late to the party, eg. due to
   constraints such as phy drivers (drivers/phy, not drivers/net/phy)
   waiting for nvmem providers, or PCS instances "going away" and
   "coming back" later.

 - removal of a PCS instance (eg. via sysfs unbind) would still
   require changes to phylink. there is no phylink function to
   impair the link in this case, and using dev_close() is a bit ugly,
   and also won't bring the link back up once the PCS (re-)appears.

 - phylink anyway is the only user of PCS drivers, and will very likely
   always be. So why create another subsystem?

All that being said I also see potential problems with Christians
current implementation as it doesn't prevent the Ethernet driver to
still store a pointer to struct phylink_pcs (returned eg. from
fwnode_pcs_get()).

Hence I would like to see an even more tight integration with phylink,
in the sense that pointers to 'struct phylink_pcs' should never be
exposed to the MAC driver, as only in that way we can be sure that
phylink, and only phylink, is responsible for reacting to a PCS "going
away".

Ie. instead of fwnode_phylink_pcs_parse() handing pointers to struct
phylink_pcs to the Ethernet driver, so it can use it to populate struct
phylink_config available_pcs member, this should be the responsibility
of phylink alltogether, directly populating the list of available PCS in
phylink's private structure.

Similarly, there should not be fwnode_pcs_get() but rather phylink
providing a function fwnode_phylink_pcs_register(phylink, fwnode) which
directly adds the PCS referenced to the internal list of available PCS.

I hope we can pick the best of all the suggested implementations, and
together come up with something even better.
