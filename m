I haven't yet: it's part of two branches in my tree at the moment, one
with Hans Verkil's CEC work in plus TDA998x and dw-hdmi support for
that, and also my imx-drm branch which contains a reworked version of
FSL's CEC code:

imx-drm:
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: place PHY into low power mode when disabled
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: start of support for pixel doubled modes
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: remove CEC engine register definitions
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi-cec: add Designware HDMI CEC driver
cec: add HDMI CEC input driver
cec: add HDMI CEC core driver
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: add HDMI notifier support
video: add HDMI state notifier support

cec:
cec: add tda9950 driver using Hans Verkil's CEC code
drm: i2c/tda998x: add CEC support
cec: add dw-hdmi cec driver using Hans Verkil's CEC code
DocBook/media: add CEC documentation
cec.txt: add CEC framework documentation
cec: add compat32 ioctl support
cec: add HDMI CEC framework
rc: Add HDMI CEC protocol handling
HID: add HDMI CEC specific keycodes
input.h: add BUS_CEC type
drm: bridge/dw_hdmi: add HDMI notifier support
video: add HDMI state notifier support

I haven't put any thought into how to get anything from these merged yet,
I was rather hoping that Hans was going to push his own CEC work to be
merged, and then I'd think about those logistics.
