I think it depends on when exactly the rproc and VPU need stay
initialized. In general, we want to turn off as much as possible as
quickly as possible, but keeping in mind any turn on latencies.

For example. if it takes 10 ms to boot rproc/VPU, we probably
shouldn't turn it off unless we already spent 20-30 ms idling, which
could be handled with runtime PM with (delayed) autosuspend. However,
things like clock gating are normally very fast, so we could just stop
any clocks as soon as frame processing ends and restart when next
frame is getting scheduled and if we use autosuspend, we wouldn't be
able to do it using PM runtime.

My point was that just open() is not the right place for doing this.
Any later stage should be okay, as long as it suits the hardware
architecture.

Best regards,
Tomasz
