Hallo Andreas,

I took a look and the pinctrl situation is different:

config PINCTRL_MT2701
	bool "Mediatek MT2701 pin control" if COMPILE_TEST && !MACH_MT2701
	(...)
	default MACH_MT2701

So the user will not be prompt about it on ARM64 (unless build-testing)
because MACH_MT2701 isn't set on ARM64. The only issue with this
construct is that you end up with useless symbols defined in the
configuration file (they can only be "n".) So I would argue that the
following is preferred:

config PINCTRL_MT2701
	bool "Mediatek MT2701 pin control"
	(...)
	depends on MACH_MT2701 || COMPILE_TEST
	default MACH_MT2701

And same for the other 3 PINCTRL_MT* options. Yes, that means the user
will be asked about the options on Mediatek kernels, but actually I
believe this is desirable, as advanced users should be allowed to
disable specific drivers if they know what they are doing. Other users
can just stick to the default.
