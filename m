Hi Rob,

Sorry to bother you again.
Can I describe usb-connector in usb node like this?

usb2: usb@11200000 {
   compatible = "mediatek,mt2701-musb";
                "mediatek,mtk-musb";
   reg = <0 0x11200000 0 0x1000>;
   ...
   usb_connector: musb_connector {
       compatible = "usb-b-connector";
       label = "micro-USB";
       type = "micro";
       extcon = <&extcon_usb>;
       vbus-supply = <&usb_vbus>;
   };
};

Regards,
Min.
