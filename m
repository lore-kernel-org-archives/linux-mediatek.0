Top-post reply.

What Bjorn says is exactly right. Just one clarifying remark: When PCI
error recovery was designed, it was envisioned for high-end,
high-availability servers so that they could reset a failing device
without forcing a reboot of the OS.  Concepts like suspend/resume did
not perturb even the unconscious sleep of the engineers. Thus,
stepping through error recovery during suspend would be novel,
untested, and perhaps prone to confusion. The error recovery procedure
is trying to reset the device into a fully-powered-on,
fully-functional and connected state. This might be problematic if the
suspend has already walked half-way through power-down. The fact that
error recovery might run a very long fraction of a second after the
error is detected further complicates things. The fact that error
recovery  usually has the driver fully reinitializing the device,
including reloading the firmware, could be a problem if the firmware
is not in RAM or is sitting on a suspended block device. So it all
could be an adventure.

As to testing: I asked one of the guys in the lab how he did it, and
he said he would brush a metal wire against the PCI pins. I winced.
But I guess it's cleaner than pouring coffee on it. Later we developed
a software tool to artificially inject errors.
