If we model "don't care" clocks inside the driver (i.e. create clk_null
in clock driver), then we don't need to model the dummy clock in device=
=2E
Is it an acceptable way?

In fact, I don't know where these clocks come from at all, especially
when they come from outside of SoC. Besides, some clocks don't need to
model in CCF, but they can be the source of clocks that controlled by
CCF.

I don't think ALL clocks on a SoC need to be handled in CCF, so there
should be some clocks don't have a "real" or "correct" parent. In
current implementation I use a dummy clock (clk_null) to be the unreal
parent.

Do you think we should model as more clocks as we can in CCF even we
don't need them? If no, how do we handle those clocks which are not
handled in CCF but can be parent of CCF clocks?


Best regards,

James
