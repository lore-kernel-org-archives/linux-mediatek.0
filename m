There might be boards with MT8173 which don't use the I2C controller,
right? So this should not go into the SoC dtsi.
For now, we just have one board dts file for MT8173, so I think we can
put it in there.
If in the future more boards get added, we can evaluate if it makes
sense to share the I2C controller pins config between them.

Thanks,
Matthias
