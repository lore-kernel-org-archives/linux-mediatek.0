The problem I see with this approach is that we scatter the code for a
otherwise simple driver over a bunch of directories. We would have

drivers/clk/mediatek/vencsys.c
drivers/reset/mediatek/vencsys.c
drivers/soc/mediatek/vencsys.c

The same must be added for vdecsys, imgsys and vencltsys. That will make
12 drivers and three maintainers for 12 registers.  I think this will be
a pain to maintain, hence my suggestion to put the vencsys code into a
single file and not split this up into more subsystem specific files.
