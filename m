Sure.

I'm not opposed to the idea of describing the association through the
DT (with a <phandle, ID> pair). My main fear is that it drags us into
endless discussions around what's considered HW description and what's
not (PTSD of all those DT-bindings discussions I suppose :-)), which
ends up delaying the merging of Panthor's protected memory support.

Honestly, at this point I'm considering going back to my initial
suggestion to add a dedicated ioctl() (requiring high privilege) to let
the user pass the memory for the FW protected sections as a dmabuf FD.
Given we don't need those sections to be populated for the FW to boot,
it wouldn't block the probe of the driver, it would just prevent PROTM
usage until those sections are populated.

This would let us make progress with the rest of the changes in this
patchset, while the community decides how they want to expose dma_heaps
to in-kernel users.
