I look into the spec of fsa9480, it indeed detect many USB accessories.
But this driver is used for simplest cases that only uses micro
receptacle with id-pin/vbus-pin

Sorry, you mean provide a common API? could you please describe more
clearer about your suggestion?


Introducing a single driver using usb_role_switch will help to keep
transparent for USB controller driver, no matter it uses type-c or micro

Thanks a lot
