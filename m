They are "xhci suspend completion" and "system suspend completion";

It's time duration

It is System Power Management which is powered off when system is
running in normal mode, and is powered on when system enters suspend
mode. It is used to wakeup system when some wakeup sources, such as
bluetooth or powerkey etc, tigger wakeup event.

But it seems only one workable approach from software side

It can be easily fixed up from hardware side by latching resume signal
until SPM is powered on.

I forgot to take into account of multiple instances

Oh!

BTW: There will be warning logs if they are not called.
