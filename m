And you will also need to remove the .of_compatible =
"mediatek,mt6323-regulator" from patch "[PATCH V2 4/4] mfd: mediatek:
add MT6323 support to MT6397 driver" since otherwise an
MODALIAS=of:foo will be reported instead of an MODALIAS=platform:foo

But if I were you, I would keep the MFD driver and DT binding as they
are and provide a .id_table and .of_match_table to the mt6323
regulator platform driver.

I'll write patches for the mt6397 regulator driver adding those tables
since it has the same issue and you can see what I mean.
