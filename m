I'll assume that 25000 is a typo.

Today, there is no guarantee - because it depends on how people have
chosen to implement 2500base-X, and whether the hardware requires the
use of in-band AN or prohibits it. This is what happens when stuff
isn't standardised - one ends up with differing implementations doing
different things, and this has happened not _only_ at hardware level
but also software level as well.

You have to also throw into this that various implementations also have
an "AN bypass" flag, which means if they see what looks like a valid
SERDES data stream, but do not see the AN data, after a certain timeout
they allow the link to come up - and again, whether that is enabled or
not is pot luck today.

From what I can see, there is no formal definition of "in-band-status"
beyond what it says on the tin. The description in the DT binding
specification, which is really where this should be formally documented,
is totally lacking.

This, and how this is implemented by mvneta, is the best we have to go
on for the meaning of this.

Given that this managed property was introduced for mvneta, mvneta's
implementation of it is the best reference we have to work out what
the intentions of it were beyond the commit text.

With in-band mode enabled, mvneta makes use of a fixed-link PHY, and
updates the fixed-link PHY with the status from its GMAC block (which
is the combined PCS+MAC).

So, when in-band mode is specified, the results from SGMII or 1000base-X
negotiation are read from the MAC side of the link, pushed into the
fixed-PHY, which then are reflected back into the driver via the usual
phylib adjust_link().

Have a read through mvneta's code at this commit:

git show 2eecb2e04abb62ef8ea7b43e1a46bdb5b99d1bf8:drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c

specifically, mvneta_fixed_link_update() and mvneta_adjust_link().
Note that when operating in in-band mode, there is actually no need
for the configuration of MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG to be touched
in any way since the values read from the MVNETA_GMAC_STATUS register
indicate what parameters the MAC is actually using. (The speed,
duplex, and pause bits in AUTONEG_CONFIG are ignored anyway if AN
is enabled.)

I know this is rather wooly, but not everything is defined in black and
white, and we need to do the best we can with the information that is
available.
