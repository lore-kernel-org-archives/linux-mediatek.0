I'm not sure it makes sense to add the GPS chip itself as it cannot be
used stand-alone AFAIU, and either not way would require a lot more
resources to be defined than what you add to this binding.

The pin names in parenthesis were copied from the sirf-star binding and
were used to capture the various names given to this supply by different
vendors. Please drop as it doesn't apply here.

While the mt3339 appears to support these interfaces, the globaltop one
does not.

Have you looked around for a small sample of mt3339-based receivers, to
see whether anyone actually provides these?

Looks like you forgot the optional NRESET input and 3D-FIX output (even
if the latter might be of limited use).
