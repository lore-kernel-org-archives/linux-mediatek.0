I ran into this bug when testing Matthias' v4.2-next/for-next branch
on mt8173.  It now crashes on boot.

Since I didn't see it elsewhere in this discussion, I'll point out
that the "regression" here was introduced by commit [0], which added
the call to map->format.format_val from regmap_bulk_read() when
map->bus == NULL.

[0] commit 15b8d2c41fe5839582029f65c5f7004db451cc2b
  Author: Arun Chandran <achandran@mvista.com>
  regmap: Fix regmap_bulk_read in BE mode

Perhaps the easiest work around to unbreak v4.2 is, as Henry mentions,
for mtk_pmic_wrap to define its own regmap_bus, with .read() &
.write() handlers.  This way they will inherit the default built-in
format_val() from the regmap core.

Making mtk_pmic-wrap into a regmap_bus makes a bit of sense
architecturally, too, since it is essentially just a bus for accessing
the registers of an off-chip PMIC.  The CPU sees a platform bus, but
the registers of the remote PMIC are accessed over a dedicated SPI
bus.

WDYT?

Henry, can you try to implement this?

Thanks,
-Dan
