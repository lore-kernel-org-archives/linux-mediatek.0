I'm a bit confused with the concepts of PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST and
PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI, from PCI express spec,
4.0r1.0(PCI_Express_Base_4.0r1.0_September-27-2017-c), Host Bridge is
"part of a Root Complex that connects a host CPU or CPUs to a
Hierarchy". While Root Complex defines as "A defined System Element that
includes at least one Host Bridge, Root port, or Root complex Integrated
Endpoint".

But according to my understanding, most of the root port IPs integrated
with a "PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI", which has type 1 configuration space and
could be saw as a pci device when using lspci.

And for MT7622, it integrated with block of internal control registers,
type 1 configuration space, and is considered as a root complex.

I'm not sure which CLASS type it should have:
>From PCI_Code-ID_r_1_10__v8-Nov_2017, class type of
0x0604(PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI) is defined as a PCI-to-PCI bridge, not
literally suitable for MT7622(which is a root complex)(In my personal
opinion). But it is the only workable CLASS type for MT7622 in current
kernel.

In the function pci_request_resource_alignment, it will by pass the
resource assignment for PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST, though I'm not figured
out why.

Do you like me to re-write the commit message for this patch and put the
above information in? Or just not mention the PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST
assign resource routine?
