Well, the fact DTs lacking the sram-supply definition went through
is a clear sign that `make dtbs_check` is not bulletproof. Not saying
the script doesn't work, but if maintainers don't run it automatically
before merging DTs, it's going to fail again, I'm afraid. If we had
enforced that "supply is mandatory" rule at runtime, we wouldn't be in
position where we have invalid DTs/DTBs merged/deployed, and I'm saying
that as the person git blame points to for introducing this logic :-).

Now that we've merged those DTs we can't really fail the probe
anyway, because that would break DT-backward compat, but flagging those
DTBs as broken (with an error message) would be better than pretending
it's all good, IMHO.

Boris
