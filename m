	/*
	 * Walk the bus hierarchy to get the devfn value
	 * of the port in the root bus.
	 */
	while (bus && bus->number) {
		devfn = bus->self->devfn;
		bus = bus->parent;
	}

Would it work ? Maybe it is a little easier to parse.

I think this can even be made easier by using struct device_node* as
comparison (and store it in port->slot instead of the port number), I
think that the pci_dev representing the port should have the right
of_node associated with it by core code, so it is just a matter of
finding the first pci_dev parent with an of_node set and compare it
against port->slot (that should be converted to a struct device_node*).

This ought to be tested and written but I think that's doable.
