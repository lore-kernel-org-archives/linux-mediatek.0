We add some extra HW function to HDMI I2C port, we have special driver
to control this HW, not generic I2C driver. This is why I don't count
this hardware to generic I2C controllers.

I personally think put I2C pins in SoC dtsi is ok because it is basic
and fixed. Almost every platform need these pins, so not necessary to
care about dtb size. And these pins are fixed. We put pins that may
change by platforms to board dts, like mmc.

We make mistake at the beginning not give these pins suitable name, if
we change now, it may affect already shipped products. So I tend to keep
it.

Since I tend to put I2C pins in SoC dtsi, I think I will put all you
mention above in SoC dtsi.
