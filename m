net: phylink: wait for PHYs that are known to probe late

This adds an opt-in deferral to phylink_fwnode_phy_connect() for PHYs
marked needs-host-firmware whose driver has not bound yet. A delayed work
item polls under rtnl_trylock() until the driver binds, then attaches and
brings up the PHY, with a bounded number of retries on connect failure.
Until then the ethtool link settings paths report no link modes or return
-EOPNOTSUPP.

[Severity: Low]
Is this accurate for this commit on its own? At this point nothing in the
tree sets phylink_config.phy_may_probe_late. The deferral in
phylink_fwnode_phy_connect() cannot be reached on the KN-1012 until the
following patch, "net: dsa: let user ports wait for a PHY that probes
late". That patch sets ds->phy_may_probe_late in mt7530_probe_common() and
copies it into dp->pl_config in dsa_user_phy_setup().

With that patch applied the MT7531 path does reach the deferral, so this
is only about the wording here. Could the message say that the fix takes
effect together with the next patch?

[Severity: Low]
Does the next open actually find the real driver? That seems to hold only
if the PHY driver module loads while the interface is down.

Suppose the module loads while genphy is bound, for example because IP
autoconfig or early userspace brought the interface up before the rootfs
module was loaded. Then driver_attach() for the real driver skips the
device:

drivers/base/dd.c:__driver_probe_device() {
    ...
	if (dev->driver)
		return -EBUSY;
    ...
}

At close, phy_detach_internal() only releases genphy:

	if (phydev->is_genphy_driven) {
		device_release_driver(&phydev->mdio.dev);
		phydev->is_genphy_driven = 0;
	}

After that nothing re-probes the device. On the next open,
phy_attach_direct() sees d->driver == NULL and binds genphy again.

Wouldn't those ndo_open MACs then get the same "no second chance" result?
Could the reason for leaving them out be reworded?

[Severity: Medium]
The kernel-doc for device_is_bound() says "This function must be called
with the device lock held." The comment explains why the lock cannot be
held across the attach. Is there a reason it cannot be taken just around
this check and dropped before phylink_attach_phy()?

Without the lock, can the check pass for a PHY whose unbind has already
started? __device_release_driver() runs device_remove(), and so
phy_remove(), before it removes knode_driver:

drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:phy_remove() {
    ...
	phydev->drv = NULL;

	return 0;
}

klist_remove(&dev->p->knode_driver) only runs after that, so
device_is_bound() can still return true while drv is being cleared.

The poller then calls phy_attach_direct() with d->driver still set, so
there is no genphy fallback. The commit message's handling ("the generic
one binds instead") does not cover this case. If phydev->drv becomes NULL
during the attach, could phy_attach_direct()
(phy_drv_supports_irq(phydev->drv)) or phylink_bringup_phy()
(phy->drv->name) dereference NULL?

The commit message notes that the wider attach/unbind race belongs to
phylib. The unlocked device_is_bound() call, though, is new in this patch.

[Severity: Low]
Suppose the real driver unbinds between phylink_phy_is_usable() and the
attach, and the genphy attach that phy_attach_direct() then does fails.
What happens here?

The genphy probe/bind failure path clears is_genphy_driven:

error_module_put:
	module_put(d->driver->owner);
	phydev->is_genphy_driven = 0;
	d->driver = NULL;

The later error path through phy_detach_internal() clears it as well.
In both cases ret is non-zero, so lost_race stays false. The poller then
logs "failed to connect late PHY" and uses up one of
PHYLINK_LATE_PHY_RETRIES. If none are left, it prints "giving up" and
stops, even though the real driver was never tried.

Should a failed attach with no real driver bound be kept out of the retry
count?

[Severity: Medium]
Can this retry end up attaching a PHY that another net_device owns?

phylink_phy_is_usable() does not check phydev->attached_dev. The PHY may
already be attached elsewhere, for example when two ports have a DT
phy-handle pointing at the same PHY, or when the PHY was attached through
another path. Then phy_attach_direct() fails here:

	if (phydev->attached_dev) {
		dev_err(&dev->dev, "PHY already attached\n");
		err = -EBUSY;
		goto error;
	}

The error label runs phy_detach_internal() on the other owner's
attachment. That clears attached_dev, phylink and phy_link_change while
the other phylink still holds the PHY in pl->phydev. This tear-down is
existing phylib behaviour.

What is new is that the -EBUSY arrives here and is retried. On the next
poll attached_dev is NULL, so the attach and phylink_bringup_phy()
succeed, and two phylink instances hold the same phy_device. A disconnect
on either side would then detach the PHY from under the other.

Should -EBUSY, or a PHY with attached_dev set, be treated as final rather
than retried?

[Severity: Medium]
Should this gate exclude MLO_AN_INBAND, or hold the link down while the
deferral is pending?

With the deferral armed and phylink started, phylink_resolve() takes the
in-band path with phy == NULL. The PHY link state is not combined in:

		if (phy)
			link_state.link &= pl->phy_state.link;

If the PCS reports link, phylink_link_up() calls mac_link_up() and turns
carrier on. The PHY is not attached, and once the retries run out it may
never be.

When the poller later attaches the PHY, phy_attach_direct() calls
netif_carrier_off(phydev->attached_dev) directly, not through
phylink_link_down(). The forced major config then reads this as false:

	cur_link_state = phylink_link_is_up(pl);

so it skips phylink_link_down()/mac_link_down(). Because
pl->phy_state.link is still 0, no down transition follows either. The next
PHY link-up would then call mac_link_up() a second time with no
mac_link_down() in between.

Does that break the mac_link_up()/mac_link_down() pairing that MAC drivers
expect?

[Severity: Low]
Is the deferred connect lost if an SFP PHY comes and goes while it is
armed?

If phylink_sfp_connect_phy() attaches a module PHY while the deferral is
armed, phylink_late_phy_poll() stops for good:

	/* A PHY arrived by another path, an SFP for one, while queued. */
	if (!phylink_late_phy_pending(pl)) {
		rtnl_unlock();
		return;
	}

When the module is removed, phylink_sfp_disconnect_phy() calls
phylink_disconnect_phy(). That now calls phylink_late_phy_cancel() and
drops late_phy_fwnode, even though the phy-handle PHY was never attached.

Nothing re-arms the deferral, so the needs-host-firmware PHY is never
connected, even after its driver binds. For a MAC that connects once, the
port stays without that PHY until the MAC is reprobed.

Reaching this needs a MAC with both an sfp property and a phy-handle to a
needs-host-firmware PHY. That may be unusual, but the comment in the
poller suggests this path is expected.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug today, but should phy_may_probe_late be documented as
incompatible with mac_requires_rxc, or checked against it?

While the connect is deferred, PHY_F_RXC_ALWAYS_ON is not passed to any
PHY. A MAC that needs RX_CLK during its own init would go through that
init with no PHY keeping it running.

No current configuration reaches this. In-tree only stmmac sets
mac_requires_rxc, and it does not opt in (the commit message names it as
a MAC that must not). mt7530 does not set mac_requires_rxc.

Adding !pl->config->mac_requires_rxc to the gate in
phylink_fwnode_phy_connect(), or noting the conflict here, would cover
future users.
