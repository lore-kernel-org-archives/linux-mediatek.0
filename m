That was just me repeating the official party line about devicetree.

I agree with you that devicetree in practice is easy to update after
shipping. But at least whenever I tried to get new bindings reviewed
I was always told that I was not allowed to count on that.

Nope, as I said "if we ever move to ...".

Yes if you can add a new helper for the current callers, then
I'm fine with dropping the quirk handling from
drm_connector_init_panel_orientation_property()
