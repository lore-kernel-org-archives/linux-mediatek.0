Wouldn't it know by presence of 'extcon' property or not?

That use case doesn't sound like something that should be in DT
though. That would be possible for any controller that supports
dual-role. Though perhaps that requires some specific Vbus wiring? Or
a cable with Vbus disconnected. Either way, doesn't sound USB
compliant.
