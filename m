I referred some dt-binding documents that contain clock and reset
controller in the same unit:

qcom,gcc.txt:

	clock-controller@900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,gcc-msm8960";

nvidia,tegra124-car.txt:

	tegra_car: clock {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-car";

rockchip,rk3188-cru.txt:

	cru: cru@20000000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3188-cru";

Rockchip use "Clock and Reset Unit" as their controller's name. The
other two use "clock" or "clock-controller" as their controller's name.

It looks like "clock-controller" is also an acceptable name for
clock/reset controllers. So I would like to keep this name in next
patch.


Best regards,

James
