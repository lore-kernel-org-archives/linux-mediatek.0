Patch applied. Very nice work!

As I've seen visiting Asia how popular MTK chips are for all kinds
of devices it's really nice to have proper upstream support directly from
Mediatek on these chips. You guys are awesome.

Some suggestions for improvements:

Have you considered replacing this with regmap-mmio? It does pretty much
the same thing. It could be an improvemet reducing code a bit and making
it more generic. The error codes from eg regmap_update_bits() can be
safely ignored on MMIO maps.

Please submit a patch implementing chip->get_direction(), it
is really helpful, especially for debugging.

If your pin controller later adds support for things that can be
used from the GPIO side, like open drain or debounce, then
please consider at that point to also implement
chip->set_config() in the gpio_chip. That way your GPIO consumers
can use e.g. open drain through pin control as back-end.
See drivers/pinctrl/intel/pinctrl-intel.c for an example.
