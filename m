Moving functionality duplicated in many drivers to a common shared
implementation is nothing unsual.

While this series proposes the new mechanism for Airoha SoC, they are
immediately useful (and long awaited) also for MediaTek and Qualcomm
SoCs.

Also in the series you posted at least the macb driver (in "[net-next
PATCH v4 09/11] net: macb: Move most of mac_config to  mac_prepare")
would benefit from that shared implementation, as all it does in it's
mac_select_pcs is selecting the PCS by a given phy_interface_t, which is
what most Ethernet drivers which use more than one PCS are doing in
their implementatio of mac_select_pcs().

Also axienet_mac_select_pcs() from "[net-next PATCH v4 08/11] net:
axienet: Convert to use PCS subsystem" could obviously very easily be
mirated to use the phylink-internal handling of PCS selection.

This might be a misunderstanding. Also here there is only a single
phylink_config for each MAC or DSA port, just instead of having many
more or less identical implementations of .mac_select_pcs, this
functionality is moved into phylink. As a nice side-effect that also
makes managing the life-cycle of the PCS more easy, so we won't need all
the wrappers for all the PCS OPs.
