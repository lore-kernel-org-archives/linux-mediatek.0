Will fix this in the next patch set.

May I know the meaning of "simply expose it as a separate controller"?
Or you might like to suggest me any similar driver as a reference? I
will examine it. Current design is based on the fact: We expect
irq-mtk-sysirq needs the optional second base but the third one will not
happen.

If we really need more than 2 bases, we can figure out a more generic
driver at the time, right?

Thanks.
