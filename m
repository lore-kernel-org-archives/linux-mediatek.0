Sorry for resurrecting a very old thread, I was able to come back to this issue
right now: there's an issue that I can't really think about how to solve with
just the usage of clk_set_rate_exclusive().

Remembering that the clock tree is as following:
TVDPLL(x) -> PLL Divider (fixed) ->
-> MUX (can choose any of TVDPLL(1/2)_d(2/4/6/8/16)) -> Gate -> Controller

The DPI driver is doing:
1. Check the best factor for setting rate of a TVDPLL
2. Set rate of one TVDPLL (specified in DT): clk_set_rate(dpi->tvd_clk, rate);
    2a. Read the rate of that PLL again to know the precise clock output
3. Set rate on the Gate clock (forwards to MUX, selecting TVDPLL(x)_d(y)):
    clk_set_rate(dpi->pixel_clk, rate);


Now, the issue is: if I change the final pixel_clk rate setting to _exclusive(),
nothing still guarantees that we will be selecting the TVDPLL that we have
manipulated in step 2, look at the following example.

tvd_clk == TVDPLL1
pixel_clk == TOP_DP (can be muxed to any tvdpll1/2 dividers!)

clk_set_rate(tvdpll1, something); new_rate = clk_get_rate(tvdpll1)

...calculations... new_rate = pixclk * factor;
...more calculations....

clk_set_rate(pixel_clk, calculated_something)
        ^^^^^^

There is still no guarantee that pixel_clk is getting parented to one of the
TVDPLL1 dividers, as it could still get parented to a TVDPLL2 divider instead
if the other controller has set TVDPLL2 to "an acceptable rate": it's true that
this would work - yes but suboptimally! - because we want to set a specific
factor to reduce jitter on the final pixel clock.


....And I came back to this commit being again the best solution for me because....

1. You also seem to agree with me that a notifier would be troublesome and would
    probably introduce glitches; and
2. clk_set_rate_exclusive() doesn't give me any guarantee about selecting the same
    PLL that the driver was manipulating before.


Am I underestimating and/or ignoring anything else in all of that?

Cheers,
Angelo
