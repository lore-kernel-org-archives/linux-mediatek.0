Based on the coccinelle script there are ~480 cases that need fixing
in total. I'll now finish all of them and then split them by
submodules as Greg suggested and repost a patch set per submodule.
Sounds good?

ok it's all clear now, thanks for clarifying.
I've defined all the 'tmp' iterator variables uninitialized so applying
your patch on top of that later will just give the nice compiler warning 
if they are used past the loop body.

Since this patch is not a complete list of cases that need fixing (30%)
I haven't included the actual change of moving the iterator variable
into the loop and thought that would be a second step coming after this
is merged.

With these changes alone, yes you still rely on manual verification passes.
