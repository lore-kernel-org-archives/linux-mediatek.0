I can't imagine either approach impacts performance. However introducing 
skip_current_trb makes the flow of the branches harder to follow.

The first branch was a version check and can remain so; we only need to 
do something special with the quirks because the MTK controller is 0.97 
but with a few bits added:

     /* MTK xHCI is mostly 0.97 but contains some features from 1.0 */
     if (xhci->hci_version < 0x100 && !(xhci->quirks & XHCI_MTK_HOST))
	    return ...

Setting trb_buff_len to zero is accommodating a quirk and this is 
clearer when we have:

     /* for MTK xHCI, TD size doesn't include this TRB */
     if (xhci->quirks & XHCI_MTK_HOST)
	    trb_buff_len = 0;

No worries.
