MT8173 and MT2701 are from different product lines so the register
control sequences are very different. If another driver for 8173-like
(or 2701-like) chip go upstream it shall share some common code with the
relatively driver indeed. However I think MT8173 and MT2701 can't share
the platform driver or a lot of "if MT8173 else MT2701" will mess up the
code.


However, several (maybe 2 or 3) tiny functions for the two driver code
are very similar indeed. For example, pointer callback functions of
platform driver are very similar. It reads the cursor and return. But
I'm not sure if it is better to share the function. It is too trivial
for me.
