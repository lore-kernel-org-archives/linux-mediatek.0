 /include/ "../../../../arm/boot/dts/cros-ec-keyboard.dtsi"

Directly embedding the relative path to .dtsi in /arm/ from .dts in
/arm64/ is more straightforward and does not require maintaining extra
symlink .dtsi files.

I actually like it better than the symlink that I proposed :-).
Consider my patch abandoned, unless someone else feels strongly.
