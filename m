Subsys is defined by GCE hardware, and other IDs are reserved currently.

That's right.

I think we can just use index.
disp0_config_base = <0x14000000 1 0xffff0000>;
disp1_config_base = <0x14010000 2 0xffff0000>;
disp2_config_base = <0x14020000 3 0xffff0000>;

it's 32 (0x0~0x1f) individually addressable 64k "subsys" blocks.
Currently, we don't have a counter example since all display related
address are put together.
