The original purpose of this patch is to provide a common dummy clock
for both software don't care clock and clock that is not software
controllable.I got comments that device tree should describe hardware
and should put exact clock in device tree. I think this is true. So we
will remove this clock_null patch, and:

1. For Mediatek SoC CCF driver, James will clarify clock usage further.
Actually, we still think it's not necessary to describe whole tree that
software don't care, James will deal this in clock driver.

2. For other module that use SW not controllable clock (mmc case
mentioned by Dan), because this is a real clock, we will put a dummy
clock in device tree, like

clk_mmchclk: dummyhclk {
	compatible = "fixed-clock";
	clock-frequency = <0>;
	#clock-cells = <0>;
};

How about this modification ?

Thanks
Eddie
