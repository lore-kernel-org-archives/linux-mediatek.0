I think what Mark means is, that we define some pinctrl_initcall which is a macro to subsys_initcall (or arch_initcall or similar). We apply this to all pinctrl drivers including the one from Mediatek. This way at least we have a common method and changing the behaviour in the future is easier to handle.
