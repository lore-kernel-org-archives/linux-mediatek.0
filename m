Thanks for your comments.

Some followups:

[1] I prefer 'header-test-' to 'header-test-n'
for excluding headers.
In some places, it will be useful to
be able to write like this:
header-test-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.h


[2] I proposed somewhat generalized header-test-pattern-y instead of
providing both of 'all_headers' and 'all_headers_with_subdir'

BTW, "all headers" should be added with care.
scripts/Makefile.asm-generic and scripts/Makefile.headersinst
cater to removing stale headers.
But, we do not explicitly clean other headers.
We always be careful about potential matching to stale headers.


[3] I tried both 'one big single Makefile' and
    'each Makefile in sub-directories'

I am slightly in favor of the former. Maybe I could be wrong,
and we may switch to the other approach.
But, I'd like to start with a single Makefile, and see how bad it is.


I sent v2:
