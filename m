@@ -35,6 +35,42 @@ Required properties for the child nodes within ports container:
 - phy-mode: String, must be either "trgmii" or "rgmii" for port labeled
 	 "cpu".
 
+Port 5 of the switch is muxed between:
+1. GMAC5: GMAC5 can interface with another external MAC or PHY.
+2. PHY of port 0 or port 4: PHY interfaces with an external MAC like 2nd GMAC
+   of the SOC. Used in many setups where port 0/4 becomes the WAN port.
+   Note: On a MT7621 SOC with integrated switch: 2nd GMAC can only connected to
+	 GMAC5 when the gpios for RGMII2 (GPIO 22-33) are not used and not
+	 connected to external component!
+
+Port 5 modes/configurations:
+1. Port 5 is disabled and isolated: An external phy can interface to the 2nd
+   GMAC of the SOC.
+   In the case of a build-in MT7530 switch, port 5 shares the RGMII bus with 2nd
+   GMAC and an optional external phy. Mind the GPIO/pinctl settings of the SOC!
+2. Port 5 is muxed to PHY of port 0/4: Port 0/4 interfaces with 2nd GMAC.
+   It is a simple MAC to PHY interface, port 5 needs to be setup for xMII mode
+   and RGMII delay.
+3. Port 5 is muxed to GMAC5 and can interface to an external phy.
+   Port 5 becomes an extra switch port.
+   Only works on platform where external phy TX<->RX lines are swapped.
+   Like in the Ubiquiti ER-X-SFP.
+4. Port 5 is muxed to GMAC5 and interfaces with the 2nd GAMC as 2nd CPU port.
+   Currently a 2nd CPU port is not supported by DSA code.
+
+Depending on how the external PHY is wired:
+1. normal: The PHY can only connect to 2nd GMAC but not to the switch
+2. swapped: RGMII TX, RX are swapped; external phy interface with the switch as
+   a ethernet port. But can't interface to the 2nd GMAC.
+
+Based on the DT the port 5 mode is configured.
+
+Driver tries to lookup the phy-handle of the 2nd GMAC of the master device.
+When phy-handle matches PHY of port 0 or 4 then port 5 set-up as mode 2.
+phy-mode must be set, see also example 2 below!
+ * mt7621: phy-mode = "rgmii-txid";
+ * mt7623: phy-mode = "rgmii";
+
 See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional
 required, optional properties and how the integrated switch subnodes must
 be specified.
