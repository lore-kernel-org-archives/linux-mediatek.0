Please don't do this. If anything, I would remove as many
includes from clk-mtk.h as possible and forward declare the
structures used in there so there isn't any header dependency.
Then it becomes clear which C files are clk-provider drivers
almost immediately because we have the include in the driver, and
we also avoid any header dependency chains where we must include
some header file if we want to get another header file's
definitions.
