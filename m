Our btcvsd radio chip is tightly bound with baseband SoC,
Currently, the mtk-btcvsd resides in mtk afe sound cards,
such as mt6797-mt6351 sound card.

"free standing ALSA driver" i'm not quite sure what you mean by this,
do you mean something like usb sound card (sound/usb/)?
Unlike normal BT SCO chip is transfer with PCM format,
we transfer encoded data directly. It's a MTK hardware-proprietary,
i'm not sure a standalone ALSA driver can do any good here.
Thats why I decided to put it under sound/soc/mediatek/.

I'll cut down the log in next patch

I'll update this in next patch

We would like to keep the exact time stamp during copy (read/write).
and the remain data in kernel temp buffer. I think its a little different
to ALSA API. I would prefer keeping this for now?
