I am doing this work in close collaboration with MTK. It is contractual
work. MTK is huge and has many BUs, one of them is WCN, formerly known
as Ralink. I have supported their MIPS silicon for many years now so
asking me to also take care of the Wireless SoCs based on ARM was the
natural next step.
