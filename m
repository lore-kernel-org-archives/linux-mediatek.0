Jasper send this series some month ago. As there was no reaction from
his side, I'll do a friendly take-over.
I tested the patches on my Helios X20 boards and they fix the issue.
I didn't add a Tested-by tag as I added my Signed-off-by.

Changes since v1:
- add a fixes tag.

Currently, DRAM-related clocks and the axi_sel MUX are not marked with
CLK_IS_CRITICAL for MT6797. This causes memory corruption when the
system is booted without clk_ignore_unused.

This patchset

1. Makes it possible to mark outputs of MUXes as critical by introducing
   a new macro, MUX_FLAGS,
2. Makes it possible to mark gates as critical by adding flags to
   mtk_gate, and
3. Marks axi_sel, ddrphycfg_sel, infra_dramc_f26m and infra_dramc_b_f26m
   as critical.

The addition of flags to mtk_gate also exists in the patch series "Add
basic and clock support for Mediatek MT8183 SoC" [1].  The type of
flags is unsigned int in that series, but the real type is unsigned
long, so my patch differs from that patch.
