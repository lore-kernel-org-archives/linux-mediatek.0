Perhaps an example would be best. In DT we would have:

	vencsys: vencsys@10000 {
		compatible = "mtk,vencsys";
		reg = <0x10000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

	myconsumer@12000 {
		compatible = "mtk,vencsys";
		reg = <0x12000 0x100>;
		clocks = <&vencsys 10>;
		clock-names = "core";
	};

	(Or are the consumers only children of the subsystem?
	It's not clear to me)

And then in the mtk,vencsys driver we would create a platform
device named something like "mtk-vencsys-clk" and assign the
of_node of the device to be the of_node that is assigned to the
mtk,vencsys device.

	static int vencsys_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
	{
		int ret;
		struct device_node *np = pdev->dev.of_node;
		struct platform_device *clk_pdev;

		clk_pdev = platform_device_alloc("mtk-vencsys-clk", -1);
		clk_pdev->dev.of_node = of_node;
		ret = platform_device_add(clk_pdev);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
	}

Then we could put a mtk-vencsys-clk driver in drivers/clk/ that
does the clk driver part...

	static int clk_vencsys_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
	{
		int ret;
		struct device_node *np = pdev->dev.of_node;
		struct regmap *regmap;

		ret = of_clk_add_provider(np, of_clk_src_onecell_get, ..);
		if (ret)
			return ret;

		regmap = dev_get_regmap(pdev->dev.parent, NULL);

	}

And similar things could be done for the reset driver.
