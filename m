You can't add clocks to the DT? Looks like mt76x8 at least should be
pretty easy with some fixed clocks.

Depending if backwards compatibility (old dtb working on new kernel)
is a concern on these platforms, you could just change all the names
both in the kernel and dts.

Generally the kernel shouldn't care what the names are (though you can
match by name, it's not widely used).

In any case, I guess fixing this can be done later.
