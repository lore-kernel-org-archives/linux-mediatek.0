New IC will have new compatible string then. If it is different, then 
likely these properties would have to change or have different meaning 
unless you use time.

Why wouldn't you just choose fine-tune for anything less than the max 
range (3200ps in this example) and course for greater than 3100ps.

What if you had a 3rd delay circuit?
