Yes it is odd to what we would normally expect. Due to our HW design,
when irq comes, audio HW actually has collected a full period of data,
but there is a buffer between the audio HW and memory, so at that moment
some samples are still in the buffer, not on the memory. Add a small
delay between triggering capture HW and enabling IRQ can also fix this,
although I think changing the avail_min should be better.

Sounds a little dangerous...How should I verify this? It this problem
platform dependent?
