Pretty much, except they both want to be called struct mtk_iommu_domain, 
so that a *declaration* for the sake of the m4u_dom member of struct 
mtk_iommu_data in the header file can remain common to both drivers - it 
then just picks up whichever private *definition* from the .c file being 
compiled.

OK, in that case I think the appropriate attribution would be along the 
lines of "Author: Honghui Zhang, based on mtk_iommu.c by Yong Wu" (if in 
doubt, grepping for "Based on" gives a feel for how this is commonly 
done). If the work that comprises this patch itself (i.e. the copying 
and modification of the existing code) is all yours then your sign-off 
alone is fine.

Ugh, right - I'd forgotten that the arch/arm DMA mapping code doesn't 
respect IOMMU groups or default domains at all. That's the real root 
cause of the issue here.

On a second look, you're doing more or less the same thing that the 
Renesas IPMMU driver currently does, so it's probably OK as a workaround 
for now. Fixing the arch/arm code is part of the bigger ongoing problem 
of sorting out IOMMU probing and DMA configuration, and it doesn't seem 
fair to force that on you for the sake of one driver ;)

That was true in the context of arm64, but you're right that the current 
state of the 32-bit code does make m4u_dom more necessary, so I guess we 
may as well leave it as-is for now.

Robin.
