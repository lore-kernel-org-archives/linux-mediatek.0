Looking at [2] I noticed that the last comment was July 4th. What is the reason
it hasn't been merged yet?

If I know [2] will be merged for 4.11, then I am fine with merging this media
patch series. The dependency of this patch on [2] is something Mauro can handle.

If [2] is not merged for 4.11, then I think it is better to wait until it is
merged.

Regards,

	Hans
