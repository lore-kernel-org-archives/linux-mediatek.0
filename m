Hi Mathias

thank you for first look on this. Patchseries is originally from Josef Fri=
edl i got some time ago for getting poweroff working on bananapi r2. There=
 it works and maybe on another devices too.

drivers/rtc/rtc-mt6397.c and drivers/rtc/rtc-mt7622.c look very differentl=
y on a diff (you've commented in part 1/3)

maybe code is compatible but i have not the knowledge to compare this...ma=
ybe sean (sorry, that i missed you) or ryder can say a word about the comp=
atibility.

no, afaik these is code taken from rtc-mt6397.c and put in a separate head=
er-file to use it in multiple c-files.

sidenote on encoding/word-wrap. i use only "git sendemail" which afaik cal=
ls sendmail (no other mta like thunderbird or similar) on ubuntu 18.4....c=
urently have no idea how to fix this...have searched before, but not yet f=
ound anything. if you have an idea please give me a hint.

regards Frank
