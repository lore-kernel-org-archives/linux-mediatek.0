We got a problem while bootup, the hang backtrace is like below(Sorry, I
can't find the full backtrace now):
 
[    7.832359] Call trace:
[    7.834778] [<ffffffc000764424>] mtk_smi_larb_get+0x24/0xa8
[    7.840300] [<ffffffc0005a1390>] mtk_drm_crtc_enable+0x6c/0x450

The reason is that "larb->mmu" is NULL while DRM call mtk_smi_larb_get.
 
DRM call iommu_present to wait for whether IOMMU is ready[1].
But in the  MTK-IOMMU, It will call
bus_set_iommu->mtk_iommu_add_device->mtk_iommu_attach_device, then it's
able to transfer "struct mtk_smi_iommu" to SMI whose probe maybe delayed
by power-domain, then SMI could finish its probe.

So If DRM probe is called after the time of calling bus_set_iommu and
before the time of SMI probe finish, this problem can be reproduced.

The root cause is that iommu_present cann't indicate that MTK-IOMMU and
SMI is ready actually. in other words, the DRM cann't detect
whether the SMI has probed done.

If we move scpsys_init from module_initcall to subsys_initcall, the
IOMMU and SMI could be probe done during the subsys_initcall period. 
this issue can be avoid.
And as we grep before, there are also some examples whose power-domain
is also not module_init[2].
core_initcall(exynos4_pm_init_power_domain);
subsys_initcall(imx_pgc_init);

If you think that this patch will hide the problem above, then I have to
add a new function, like below:
//==================
bool mtk_smi_larb_ready(struct device *larbdev)
{
	struct mtk_smi_larb *larb = dev_get_drvdata(larbdev);

	return larb && !!larb->mmu;
}
//=================

And in the probe of all the MTK-IOMMU consumer, we have to add this:
//====================
	if (!mtk_smi_larb_ready(&larb_pdev->dev))
		return -EPROBE_DEFER;
//====================

The sequence is a little complex, If I don't explain clearly, please
tell me.
Any other suggestion about this? Thanks.
