I wrote a WDMA driver a long ago, but I couldn't get it to work (though, I admit I
didn't try hard to actually get it working).... if you want to take a look to check
if anything obvious is missing, the driver is here:

https://gitlab.collabora.com/mediatek/aiot/linux/-/blob/mediatek-dev/drivers/gpu/drm/mediatek/mtk_disp_wdma.c?ref_type=heads

The driver I wrote was supposed to work on MT8781 Helio G99 (for a personal project
as in upstreaming of the Xiaomi Poco M5 smartphone) and on MT8195 as a PoC.
I did test both platforms and this driver didn't work on both... not sure if that
was because I misconfigured the MMSYS routing (on both) or if there's any actual
issue with the driver I wrote.

Again, didn't invest much time on this, anyway, so some obvious issue might be
present.

Cheers,
Angelo
