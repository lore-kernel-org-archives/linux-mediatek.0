I can see your reasoning, but the device tree maintainers prefer to have 
the bindings updated for a new SoC. As I mentioned before, just imagine 
next year Mediatek changes the IP block and from now on, it uses the new 
device in all SoCs. In 5 years we would have a binding which states 
'generic' although it is not compatible with any SoC of the last So

So please keep with the bindings as done up to now.
