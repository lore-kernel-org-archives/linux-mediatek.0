Well, but this isn't just like any other regulator-fixed in a DTSI. In this case
it is part of a multi-function device (MFD) and so it gets probed by a parent
node. That's the source of the issue, because then no driver gets assigned to
the node itself.

The DT kselftest is a run-time test, so it wouldn't be able to distinguish
between DTSI and DTS. But in any case, we do want to check that devices from
DTSIs have probed, a lot of the devices come from them. When a particular board
doesn't actually have a node from a DTSI present then the node should be
disabled, and in that case the kselftest ignores the node.

It would be possible to ignore this particular compatible, "regulator-fixed", in
the kselftest, if it is a compatible that can't be expected to be probed. Of
course that would mean that all the other regulator nodes that aren't MFD
children and do get probed by that driver would no longer be checked by the
test.

Ah, yes, totally agreed, I seem to have missed running dtbs_check on this patch,
sorry. Indeed now either the binding needs to be fixed or the patch reverted.

I believe the most reasonable option would be to update those regulators in the
binding to reference the generic regulator binding, ie:

diff --git a/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mediatek,mt6357-regulator.yaml b/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mediatek,mt6357-regulator.yaml
index 6327bb2f6ee0..9308008f420e 100644
--- a/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mediatek,mt6357-regulator.yaml
+++ b/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mediatek,mt6357-regulator.yaml
@@ -33,7 +33,7 @@ patternProperties:

   "^ldo-v(camio18|aud28|aux18|io18|io28|rf12|rf18|cn18|cn28|fe28)$":

     description:

as well as updating the examples in the YAML. The fixed-regulator.yaml binding
doesn't seem to provide any additional checks compared to regulator.yaml,
besides enforcing the regulator-fixed compatible, which in this case doesn't
serve any purpose.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Nícolas
