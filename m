If a PCIe link goes down here's my understanding of what happens:

  - Writes to the device are silently dropped.

  - Reads from the device return ~0 (PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR()).

  - If the device is in a slot and pciehp is enabled, a Data Link
    Layer State Changed interrupt will cause pciehp_unconfigure_device()
    to detach the driver and remove the pci_dev.

  - If AER is enabled, a failed access to the device will cause an AER
    interrupt.  If the driver has registered pci_error_handlers, the
    driver callbacks will be called, and based on what the driver
    returns, the PCI core may reset the device.

The pciehp and AER interrupts are *asynchronous* to link down events
and to any driver access to the device, so they may be delayed an
arbitrary amount of time.

Both interrupt paths may lead to the device being marked as "offline".
Obviously this is asynchronous with respect to the driver.

This looks like an unreliable way to detect issues.  It only works if
AER is enabled, and the device is only marked "offline" some arbitrary
length of time *after* a driver access to the device has failed.

You can't reliably detect errors on writes to the device.

You can only reliably detect errors on reads from the device by
looking for PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR().  Obviously ~0 might be a valid value
to read from some registers, so you need device-specific knowledge to
know whether ~0 is valid or indicates an error.

If AER or DPC are enabled, the driver can be *notified* about read
errors and some write errors via pci_error_handlers, but the
notification is long after the error.
