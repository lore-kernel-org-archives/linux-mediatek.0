Not saying that MediaTek is the only one that uses such bindings style, at all.

I admit I was too tough about that, but as of the current state, the *binding*
is not generic, and it's strictly tied to the GPIO Controller IP version of one
specific SoC.

While this style is generic, the actual pinmux *definitions* in the header are
not generic - that's what I wanted to say, and I admit I went a bit too vague
with words that are easy to misunderstand.

PINMUX_GPIO138__FUNC_SPIM1_MO -> s/PINMUX_GPIO138__FUNC_//g/ and s/_MO//g

M1 stands for "Master 1" - that's because technically there could be a different
pinfunc for SPI "Slave 1" function.

That's SoC-specific anyway, not all of them have SPIS1, not all of them need
a different function, and... you get the point, I'm sure :-)

Then we must find a way to decouple hardware-specific information from the actual
header I think?

Alternatively - that's what I have understood - and if I've understood that wrong,
this needs clarification from the bindings maintainers, and why they wanted the
MediaTek pinctrl bindings to get moved to arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/ instead of
include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/

Bindings maintainers, any word on this?

Did I misunderstand anything in past reviews ... from krzk if I remember correctly?

Angelo
