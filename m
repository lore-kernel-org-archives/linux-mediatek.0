Right, so my understanding of the DT ABI thing is that newer kernels=20
should keep working with older DTs. If there isn't any DT using the=20
binding, then we don't have a problem because the only thing that could=
=20
happen would be a newer DT working with an older kernel, which doesn't=20
make any sense from a backwards incompatible standpoint.

If you feel strongly that some sort of DT ABI rule would be broken and=20
you want to make sure that doesn't happen I guess we can queue this up=20
to be sent off to Linus, but if you aren't worried (and I'm obviously=20
not worried) then I'd prefer we just queue it up for 4.3.
