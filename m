No, you are declaring "memory" node somewhere else. Perhaps using
skeleton.dtsi which we are trying to remove or you have some default.

Using just 'memory' is fine if the base address is variable and
determined at boot time or you have a bootloader that expects just
'memory'. Otherwise, this should be fixed, but you can do that after
this patch if you want.
