The MFD driver sets .of_compatible = "mediatek,mt6397-regulator" for
the MFD cell so I'm pretty sure that the platform bus .uevent callback
will report a MODALIAS=of:NfooT<NULL>C"mediatek,mt6397-regulator" so
that's what udev is going to pass to kmod but:

kmod load of:NfooT<NULL>C"mediatek,mt6397-regulator"

is not going to succeed since there won't be a kernel module with that alias.

Did you really try building it as a module and checked that it auto loads?

In any case, I think the correct thing to do is to provide a .match
and .of_match tables for the platform driver. Since in the future if
you need to support another device with the same driver, you will need
to add another MODULE_ALIAS(). And also is better to be consistent on
what is matched and what is reported to user-space as a module alias.
