No that doesn't answer my question. Yes you can always call
enable_irq_wake(irq) as along as you have irq_set_wake implemented.
But my question was does this pinmux controller support wake-up
configuration.

IMHO, by looking at the implementation I can confirm *NO*, it doesn't.
So please stop copy-pasting the implementation from other drivers.
The reason is you operate on the same mask_{set,clear} which you use
to {en,dis}able the interrupts which means you don't have to do anything
to configure an interrupt as a wakeup source other than just keeping
them enabled. Hopefully this clarifies.

Again *YES* for what part of my question. If it's always-on, then you
don't need this suspend/resume callbacks at all, so I assume the answer
is *NO*.

I understand that, but for proper wakeup functionality you need to do
configure the parent if you want to identify and handle that wakeup
interrupt. If you don't care then it should be fine.

Yes I got that, as I mentioned above, I think you don't need to identify
and handle the wakeup interrupt. E.g. if it's a keyboard key press, you
may need to identify the key pressed, so it needs to be handled
properly. In your case, I assume it's just power button whose main
function is to wake/boot and that's already achieved when you are woken up.
