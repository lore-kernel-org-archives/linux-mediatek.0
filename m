Correct.

We got here through cases such as the one I pointed out where I tried
to highlight the issue. Maybe something happened in the pcs-lynx case,
it's pretty hard to find the history via google now, because searching
there does not give all the different versions of the patch set.

Maybe it was some other PCS, I don't know. Same problem, searching
google is very patchy at finding the various versions of patchsets
that were submitted.

All I know is that at some point I gave up pointing the issue out.

pcs-lynx today does issue an error. pcs-xpcs doesn't, it just turns
off AN no matter what. I can't find the history via google for that.

Why what? Why I stopped caring about this issue? Or Why we ended up
with drivers configuring the above without AN? I think for the latter
I've explained how we got here. For the former, it's the feeling that
my comments were being ignored or just lead to arguments, so I stopped
bothering.

I think I said "can be implemented", meaning not everyone does.

You seem to think that the above DT stanza can end up with in-band AN
enabled.

FFS. You're the one who's writing emails to me that include *both*
"fixed-link" and "in-band-status" together. I'm pointing out that
specifying that in DT for a port together is not permitted.

And here I give up reading this email. Sorry, I'm too frustrated
with this nitpicking, and too frustrated with spending hours writing a
reply only to have it torn apart.
