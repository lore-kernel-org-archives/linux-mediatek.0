Actually only mt2712 which have 2 M4U HW need "mediatek,larb-id".

This is larbs in the m4u0/1 dtsi node of mt2712:
m4u0 { mediatek,larbs = <&larb0 &larb1 &larb2 &larb3 &larb6>;}
m4u1 { mediatek,larbs = <&larb4 &larb5 &larb7>;}

the id don't increase one by one, M4U have to get the larbid with the
help of "mediatek,larb-id".

(The m4u/smi dtsi patch of mt2712 will be send with some other modules,
maybe in this week.)


> 2) how this will work if we do not parse the larb-id for v1 iommu at all

As you said above and I also have wrote that the larbid "must sort
according to the local arbiter index" in the "mediatek,larbs"
description of dt-binding. All the M4U except mt2712 could ignore
"mediatek,larb-id". the v1 iommu also should be ok.

I'm not sure whether we should change [1], if only reserving mt2712
there, we also should change the dtsi file of mt2701 and mt7623.or keep
it as is.
