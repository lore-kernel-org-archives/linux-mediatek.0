True, though I'm still not entirely sure whether mtk_mfg needs to do
the GF_REG_SHADER_PRESENT thing. It's entirely possible this is just
an efuse value the GPUEB reads and then puts in SRAM for us, and we
could simply read this efuse cell ourselves. Among a list of questions
about the hardware we're sending to MediaTek, whether this is an efuse
cell and where it is placed is one of them.

If it turns out to be the case that we can simply read an efuse in
panthor in the other mt8196 integration code, then we can keep
mtk_mfg basically entirely focused on the devfreq-y part. I'd really
prefer this solution.

However, assuming we can't go down this path either because this is
not how the hardware works, or because MediaTek never replies, or
because someone doesn't like reading efuses in panthor, I think
generalising "devfreq_provider" to "performance_controller" or
something like that would be a good move.

In a way, the fused off core mask is part of the vague domain of
"performance", and it'll also allow us to extend it with other
things relevant to performance control in different vendor integration
logic designs. I'm thinking memory bandwidth control and job scheduling
preferences. E.g. if the interconnect tells us one core is spending a
lot of time waiting on the interconnect, maybe because a different
piece of the SoC that's active shares the same path on the
interconnect, we could then communicate a scheduling preference for
the other cores that have bandwidth headroom even if they are busier
in compute. Maybe this doesn't make sense though because interconnect
designs are fully switched these days or panthor's scheduler will
already figure this out from job completion times.

If any other SoC vendor or people working on hardware of those vendors
want to chime in and say whether they've got any other uses for
communicating more than just devfreq from glue logic to panthor, then
this would be a great time to do it, so that we can get this interface
right from the beginning.

I'm not very confident it's possible to cleanly decouple them without
inventing a bunch of very panthor-and-mfg specific interfaces that
masquerade as general solutions in the process. It'd also mean I'd
have to duplicate all of `panthor_devfreq_get_dev_status` instead of
just being able to reuse it, unless that is also exposed in said
header file, which would need a better justification than "well there
is one other user of it and we're trying to couple it more loosely".

I know that it's almost independent, but unfortunately, even a tiny
dependency between the two will mean that mediatek_mfg will need to
know about panthor.

Other things needed from panthor are the pdevfreq->gov_data, and
the panthor struct device* itself, as well as stuff like "fast_rate"
in the panthor_device struct.

In the future, we may want to expand this driver with governors
beyond SIMPLE_ONDEMAND, based on the job completion duration targets
we can communicate to the GPUEB. That may either make the driver
more tightly coupled or more loosely coupled, I don't really know
yet.

One advantage of looking to completely decouple them (though again,
I doubt that's possible at the moment without questionable refactors)
could be that we could also support panfrost devices that need this.
