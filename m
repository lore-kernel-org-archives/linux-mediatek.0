MT7621 also have the circuit for pad setup tweaking Tx driving and mux
setup switching to either gpio mode or specific hardware mode, but the
circuit for all of them is being accessed in a different register range
from gpio controller being implemented here.

the part of pad or mux control for MT7621 I thought that is really
simple, so it seems worth joining pinmux and pinconf together into a
single driver to become a full function about pin setup.

The MT7621 is just as completely different as night and day from MT7622.

MT7622 pinctrl originate from MediaTek IPs but MT7621 pinctrl originate
from Ralink IPs and even MT7621 should be the last one machine using the
Ralink pinctrl IPs. And for these machine MT762x appearing later MT7622,
they all will be developed based on pinctrl-mt7622 architecture .
