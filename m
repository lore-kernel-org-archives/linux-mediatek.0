The ones that have a FROMLIST are actually backports taken from the mailinglist, 
so please search for them. Good starting point is linux-mediatek and 
linux-arm-kernel newsgroups.

For this patch the latest submission is these:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9427541/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9427543/

Please take up this patches and resubmit with the comments addressed by the 
reviewers.

Keep up the good work!
Matthias
