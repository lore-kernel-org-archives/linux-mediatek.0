Hi Bin,

Thanks for your help.

Hi Rob,

I find that Samsung describes the usb-connector attribute in DTS, and
uses a private driver.
And try to write DTS as following:

usb-connector node:
musb_con: musb_connector{
    compatible = "linux,extcon-usb-gpio","usb-b-connector";
    lable = "micro-USB";
    type = "micro";
    id-gpio = <&pio 44 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
    vbus-supply = <&usb_vbus>;
    port {
        usb_to_connector: endpoint {
            remote-endpoint = <&connector_to_usb>;
        };
    };
};

usb node:
&usb2{
    status = "okay";
    port {
        connector_to_usb: endpoint {
            remote-endpoint = <&usb_to_connector>;
        };
    };
}

Can I describe usb-connector like this? Or can you give me some advices?

Regards,
Min.
