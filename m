I think that instead of explaining why have to duplicate the code you
should rather search for ways how the code can be shared. Yes, we'll
need a second (early) entry point to the driver. Maybe we even have to
create the shared code which is then called from the driver and your
early architecture code.
You'll probably have to do this separation between early code and
regular driver code in your driver anyway, since I bet the MT6580 also
has some power domains which shall be controlled by the regular Linux
power domain code later. Also we probably could control the CPU power
domains for the MT8173 in the SCPSYS driver aswell, we just don't have
to because we use PSCI there. You see we are approaching the same
problem from two different corners. Let's find a way to share the code.
