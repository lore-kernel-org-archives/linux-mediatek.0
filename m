Wait - the designer said to use clk26m, but you tested with CLK_TOP_MFG_SEL.
Now I am even more confused.
Which is the correct clock to use for the mfg power domains?

In other versions of the SCPSYS patch set, the scpsys node has
additional "subsystem bus clocks".
So will we need additional patches later to add back these additional
clocks which have been removed from the current version of this pach?
In other words, will there be a follow up patch like below, plus
another patch to add these clocks to "enum clk_id":

If so, is there a reason we cannot just include these clocks in the
current version of the SCPSYS driver?
