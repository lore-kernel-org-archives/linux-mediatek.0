FYI. I started working on MT6797 pinctrl support but never got time to
finish it. You can find my initial work below. Eventhough it is based on
the Mediatek SDK it should be fine IMO.

It would be great if someone (Saber) can took and finish it. The hard
bit for me was lack of proper documentation :(
