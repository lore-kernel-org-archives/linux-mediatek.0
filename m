[ Upstream commit 573d6e3afe3d01e34dc82c77bf22ca96a74d805e ]

core_rmw() accesses the MMD core registers directly rather than
through the regmap and has the same unchecked bus->read() as the
one just fixed in the MDIO regmap backend: a negative errno is
consumed as register data, modified and written back to the switch.
Check the read and bail out like the surrounding bus accesses do.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit message forensics

**Step 1.1: Subject line**
Record: `[net: dsa: mt7530]` [`check`] [detect `bus->read()` failure in
`core_rmw()` instead of treating errno as register data]

**Step 1.2: Tags**
Record:
- `Signed-off-by: Daniel Golle <daniel@makrotopia.org>` (author)
- `Reviewed-by: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>` (DSA co-maintainer)
- `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/48bb9f0b311a9efeda2a6b24a7e05d4792393a
  3b.1785811140.git.daniel@makrotopia.org`
- `Signed-off-by: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>` (netdev maintainer)
- No `Fixes:` in the committed message
- Mailing-list submission **did** include `Fixes: b8f126a8d543 ("net-
  next: dsa: add dsa support for Mediatek MT7530 switch")` (verified in
  the saved mbox); it was dropped before mainline
- No `Reported-by:`, `Tested-by:`, `Cc: stable` in the committed message
  (absence is expected)

**Step 1.3: Body**
Record:
- **Bug:** `core_rmw()` talks to MMD core registers via raw
  `bus->read()`/`bus->write()`, not regmap. A failed `bus->read()`
  returns a negative errno, which is used as the current register value,
  masked/ORed, and written back.
- **Symptom:** garbage RMW into switch MMD registers (clock-gate bits on
  this path).
- **Root cause:** same unchecked-read pattern as the MDIO regmap
  backend, which this tree already has as `93d46870c5440`.
- **Version info:** none in the body. The inlined form is from
  `7c5e37d7ee78d` (v6.11 era, present here). The mailing-list `Fixes:`
  points at the 2017 driver introduction; the old
  `core_read_mmd_indirect()` had the same unchecked read.

**Step 1.4: Hidden bug fix?**
Record: Not hidden. Explicit error-path correctness fix: missing check →
errno treated as data → written to hardware.

---

## Phase 2: Diff analysis

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
Record:
- File: `drivers/net/dsa/mt7530.c`
- Scope: ~5 insertions / 1 deletion in one function
- Function: `core_rmw()`
- Classification: single-file surgical fix

**Step 2.2: Code flow**
Record:
- **Before:** after three checked MMD address writes, `val =
  bus->read(...)`. No check. `val &= ~mask; val |= set;` then
  `bus->write(...)`.
- **After:** `ret = bus->read(...)`; if `ret < 0` goto the existing
  `err` path (log + unlock); else `val = ret` and continue the RMW.
- Path: error path of an MDIO read during RMW. Normal success path
  unchanged.

**Step 2.3: Bug mechanism**
Record:
- Category: logic / correctness on an error path (errno consumed as
  register data, then written back). Same class as the already-present
  MDIO regmap fix.
- `mii_bus->read` returns a 16-bit value or a negative errno
  (`include/linux/mdio.h`: “returns value or negative error code”).
  `val` is `u32`, so `-ETIMEDOUT` (-110) becomes `0xffffff92`.
  `bus->write()` takes `u16`, so the switch sees `0xff92` with the
  intended bit tweaks, not the real register contents.
- Mechanism: check `ret < 0` and skip the write, matching the
  surrounding writes.

**Step 2.4: Fix quality**
Record:
- Obviously correct; copies the existing write-error pattern in the same
  function.
- Minimal; no unrelated edits, no API change.
- Regression risk: very low. On read failure it no longer writes.
  `core_rmw()` is still `void` and still only logs (pre-existing); this
  patch does not invent a new return convention.
- `val = ret` after the check is safe: success values are 0..0xffff.

---

## Phase 3: Git history

**Step 3.1: Blame**
Record:
- Unchecked read at lines 155–156: `7c5e37d7ee78d` (“simplify core
  operations”, Arınç ÜNAL, 2024-04-18).
- That commit inlined `core_read_mmd_indirect()`, which already returned
  `bus->read()` without checking. The defect dates to `b8f126a8d543`
  (2017), driver introduction.
- Inlined form is in this tree (`git merge-base --is-ancestor
  7c5e37d7ee78d HEAD` succeeded). `git describe --contains` places it
  around v6.11-rc1, so it is in 6.12.

**Step 3.2: Fixes: tag**
Record: No `Fixes:` on the committed patch. Submission tagged
`b8f126a8d543`, which **is** an ancestor of this tree. Intermediate:
`7c5e37d7ee78d` inlined the helper and kept the bug.

**Step 3.3: File history**
Record:
- This tree already has the sibling: `93d46870c5440` “check bus->read()
  errors in the MDIO regmap backend”.
- Also: `96e0f5184af69` “error out on failed reads in MT7531 PHY
  polling”.
- Candidate `573d6e3afe3d0` is **not** an ancestor of HEAD.
- Standalone vs series: mailing-list subject is `[PATCH net v2 2/6]`.
  Diff does not depend on 1/6 or 3–6/6.

**Step 3.4: Author**
Record: Daniel Golle is a regular MT7530 contributor (OpenWrt/MediaTek).
Nearby commits by him in this tree are the other MDIO-error fixes.
Reviewed by Andrew Lunn.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
Record: None for this hunk. It uses existing `ret`, `goto err`, and
`bus->read`/`bus->write`. `git apply --check` succeeded (hunk offset 28
lines only).

---

## Phase 4: Mailing list / external research

**Step 4.1: Original discussion**
Record:
- `b4 dig -c 573d6e3afe3d0` → https://patch.msgid.link/48bb9f0b311a9efed
  a2a6b24a7e05d4792393a3b.1785811140.git.daniel@makrotopia.org
- Series: `[PATCH net v2 0/6] net: dsa: mt7530: fix remaining swallowed
  MDIO access errors`
- v2: “no changes” for this patch; Andrew’s `Reviewed-by` kept.
- Cover letter: leftover companion of the first “swallowed MDIO read
  errors” series (already on `net`); this is the unchecked `bus->read()`
  in `core_rmw()`.
- Sent to `net` (fixes), not `net-next`.
- No NAK in the saved mbox. Applied by Jakub Kicinski (`0200d48477602`
  merge).

**Step 4.2: Recipients (`b4 dig -w`)**
Record: Andrew Lunn, Vladimir Oltean, netdev maintainers, MediaTek,
`netdev@`, `linux-mediatek@`. Right audience. Lunn reviewed.

**Step 4.3: Bug report**
Record: No syzbot/bugzilla. Found by review of the same MDIO-error class
(cover letter cites Sashiko AI review of the parent series).

**Step 4.4: Series**
Record: 6 patches. This is 2/6 and is self-contained. 3–5/6 are other
swallowed-error sites; 1/6 is `pcs-mtk-lynxi`; 6/6 is IRQ-chip
serialization. Not required for this hunk.

**Step 4.5: Stable list**
Record: **UNVERIFIED** — lore.kernel.org returned 403/503 to
WebFetch/curl. No local evidence this was rejected for stable.

---

## Phase 5: Code semantics

**Step 5.1: Functions**
Record: `core_rmw()` only.

**Step 5.2: Callers**
Record:
- `core_set()` / `core_clear()` → `core_rmw()`
- `mt7530_pll_setup()`: clear/set `REG_GSWCK_EN` on
  `CORE_TRGMII_GSW_CLK_CG` (switch setup, 40 MHz XTAL)
- `mt7530_setup_port6()`: clear/set `REG_TRGMIICK_EN` (port 6 TRGMII
  clock)
- `mt7530_pll_setup()` from `mt7530_setup()` (~line 2422)
- `mt7530_setup_port6()` from `mt7530_mac_config()` when `port == 6`

**Step 5.3: Callees**
Record: `mt7530_mutex_lock/unlock`, `bus->write`, `bus->read`,
`dev_err`.

**Step 5.4: Reachability**
Record: Yes, from DSA probe/setup and phylink MAC config on MT7530
(common in MediaTek routers). Not a syscall hot path; hit on bring-up
and port-6 mode changes. Userspace/netlink can trigger `mac_config`.

**Step 5.5: Similar patterns**
Record: Same bug already fixed in `mt7530_regmap_read()` in this tree.
`core_write()` only writes (no analogous read). Remaining siblings
(PHY_IAC writes, CORE_PLL_GROUP4, FDB/VLAN cmd) are other series
patches, not prerequisites.

---

## Phase 6: This tree (6.12.y)

**Step 6.1: Buggy code present?**
Record: Yes. Tree is `pending-6.12` / `6.12.111`
(`p-6.12-4-gbf6fcdf761abd`). Current `core_rmw()` still does `val =
bus->read(...)` with no check (`drivers/net/dsa/mt7530.c:155-156`).
`573d6e3afe3d0` is not an ancestor of HEAD.

**Step 6.2: Backport difficulty**
Record: Clean apply (`git apply --check`: hunk succeeded at offset 28).
Surrounding `core_rmw()` matches the pre-image.

**Step 6.3: Related fixes already here?**
Record: Regmap-backend check is here; PHY polling check is here. This
leftover `core_rmw()` instance is not. No alternate fix of this
function.

---

## Phase 7: Subsystem context

**Step 7.1**
Record: `drivers/net/dsa/mt7530.c` — MediaTek MT7530 DSA. **IMPORTANT**
(common embedded/router switch), not core mm/VFS, not staging.

**Step 7.2**
Record: Actively maintained; recent 6.12 backports already include other
MT7530 MDIO-error and hardware fixes.

---

## Phase 8: Impact and risk

**Step 8.1: Who is affected**
Record: Driver-specific: `CONFIG_NET_DSA_MT7530` (MDIO-attached
MT7530/MT7531, common on MT7621/MT798x-class boards).

**Step 8.2: Trigger**
Record: `bus->read()` failure during PLL/clock RMW (timeout, NACK, flaky
MDIO). Not every boot if the bus is healthy. Unprivileged users do not
trigger MDIO failure directly; they can hit the RMW via interface/port
config. Timing/hardware dependent.

**Step 8.3: Failure mode**
Record: On MDIO read failure, a truncated errno (e.g. `0xff92`) is
written to `CORE_TRGMII_GSW_CLK_CG` (core / TRGMII clock gates) instead
of toggling bit 0 or 1. That can leave clocks misconfigured (no link /
switch not forwarding) rather than failing closed. Severity: **HIGH** on
that error path (hardware misconfiguration), not a panic/UAF.

**Step 8.4: Risk-benefit**
Record:
- Benefit: stops garbage writes to switch clock-gate MMDs; completes the
  same class already backported via the regmap patch.
- Risk: very low (4–5 lines, existing `err` path, no locking/API
  change).
- Ratio: favorable.

---

## Phase 9: Synthesis

**For backporting**
- Real bug: negative MDIO errno used as register data and written back.
- Consequence: corrupt RMW of switch clock-gate registers.
- Small, obviously correct, reviewed by Andrew Lunn, taken into `net` as
  a fix.
- Buggy code is in this 6.12 tree; patch applies cleanly.
- Same class as `93d46870c5440`, already in this tree; this is the
  leftover `core_rmw()` site.

**Against**
- Error path only (MDIO must already be failing).
- Still `void`; errors are only logged (pre-existing).
- No syzbot/user crash report.
- Labelled 2/6, but this hunk does not need the rest.

**Unresolved**
- Stable-list discussion (lore 403/503). Does not change the technical
  case.

**Stable rules**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **PASS** — matches surrounding checks;
   Lunn `Reviewed-by`; in mainline `net`.
2. Real user-affecting bug? **PASS** — garbage written to MT7530 clock-
   gate MMDs on read failure.
3. Important (crash/security/corruption/deadlock)? **PASS** — hardware
   misconfiguration of switch clocks; same class already accepted in
   this tree.
4. Small and contained? **PASS** — ~5 lines, one function.
5. No new features/APIs? **PASS**.
6. Applies to this tree? **PASS** — `git apply --check` clean.

**Exception category:** none (not an ID/quirk/DT/build/doc exception).
Qualifies as a normal small driver bugfix.

### What the commit solves for this tree

In 6.12, `core_rmw()` still assigns `bus->read()` to `u32 val` without
checking. On timeout/NACK that errno is masked, OR’d, and written to
`CORE_TRGMII_GSW_CLK_CG` during PLL setup and port-6 TRGMII clock
enable. The fix bails out like the three preceding writes. It is the
companion to the regmap-backend check already present here.

Risk is negligible; benefit is avoiding a bad clock-gate RMW when MDIO
fails on a widely used MediaTek DSA switch.

Verification:
- [Phase 1] Parsed tags: Lunn `Reviewed-by`, msgid link; no committed
  `Fixes:`; mbox had `Fixes: b8f126a8d543`
- [Phase 2] Diff: 5 insertions in `core_rmw()`; check `ret < 0` before
  RMW write
- [Phase 3] Blame: inlined by `7c5e37d7ee78d` (v6.11, in this tree);
  original unchecked read in `b8f126a8d543` (2017)
- [Phase 3] `git merge-base --is-ancestor 573d6e3afe3d0 HEAD` → not in
  tree; `7c5e37d7ee78d` is in tree
- [Phase 3] Sibling `93d46870c5440` is in this tree
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c 573d6e3afe3d0`: v2 2/6 of “fix remaining
  swallowed MDIO access errors”; v2 no changes; Lunn review on 1–3 and 6
- [Phase 4] Cover letter: leftover `core_rmw()` companion of the first
  MDIO-error series
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -w`: netdev + DSA + MediaTek CCs
- [Phase 4] lore WebFetch/curl 403/503; thread recovered via `b4 dig -m`
- [Phase 5] Callers: `mt7530_pll_setup`, `mt7530_setup_port6` → DSA
  setup / `mac_config`
- [Phase 5] `bus->read` contract: value or negative errno
  (`include/linux/mdio.h`)
- [Phase 6] `git describe HEAD`: `p-6.12-4-gbf6fcdf761abd`; `make
  kernelversion`: 6.12.111; buggy `val = bus->read` still at
  mt7530.c:155
- [Phase 6] `git apply --check` of `573d6e3afe3d0`: succeeded (offset
  28)
- [Phase 8] Failure mode: truncated errno written to
  `CORE_TRGMII_GSW_CLK_CG`; severity HIGH on that error path
- UNVERIFIED: whether stable@ discussed this commit (lore unreachable)

**YES**
