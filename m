I don't want a kconfig option for this. I think it should be dynamic instead.

The current flow is like this:

for each reserved node:
  - call memblock_reserve
  - Add info to reserved_mem array

I think we should change it to:

for each reserved node:
  - call memblock_reserve
  - count number of nodes

Alloc array using memblock_alloc

for each reserved node:
   - Add info to reserved_mem array
