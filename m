What exactly do the restrictions look like and how often do they vary in
practice (can we get away with just doing a single static setup in the
driver)?  I'd have thought it should be fairly straightforward to have a
table of valid mappings and just pick the first free memory interface?
I'd rather not get stuck with the tables in the DT.  It's partly to
avoid setting bad precendents, we really don't want everyone coming
along hard coding this stuff, and partly because the hardware you
described didn't seem that hard to handle.

Yeah, one of those :) but probably an ALSA control is going to be the
easiest for applications.
