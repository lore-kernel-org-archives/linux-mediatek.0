After looking a bit more into this, I'm feel that the clk_null approach is 
wrong.

For one, even if the clk_null stuff would be ok, the binding doc of the clock 
controller does not describe the need of this specific clock at all.


The other more important point, looking at clk-mt8173 I see at least these 
clocks being set as children of "clk_null":

static const struct mtk_fixed_factor root_clk_alias[] __initconst = {
	FACTOR(CLK_TOP_CLKPH_MCK_O, "clkph_mck_o", "clk_null", 1, 1),
	FACTOR(CLK_TOP_DPI, "dpi_ck", "clk_null", 1, 1),
	FACTOR(CLK_TOP_USB_SYSPLL_125M, "usb_syspll_125m", "clk_null", 1, 1),
	FACTOR(CLK_TOP_HDMITX_DIG_CTS, "hdmitx_dig_cts", "clk_null", 1, 1),
};


These look more like they are fed from some external source to the clock 
controller? I did ask Matthias but he also couldn't find anything describing 
where these clocks actually come from.
