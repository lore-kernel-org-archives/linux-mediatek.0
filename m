If it's set in the preloader (and maybe changed at runtime) this means, its 
setting can also be read back to determine its current clock rate, so this is 
a non-argument here ;-)

As Daniel said, some of these clocks may be parents of other clocks, and not 
knowing their rate might hurt in the future - especially when it's easy after 
all to get its actual value like in your CLKPH_MCK_O example above.
