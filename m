On i.MX we started with i2cN_pins_[abcde] groups in the SoC dtsi file
aswell. At some point we realized that this does not scale anymore.
The problems were:

- Whenever a new board came along which needed some pin setting which
  didn't already exist a new group was created in the SoC dtsi file using
  the next free letter from the alphabet. The ordering of the group names
  was rather arbitrary and often enough there were merge conflicts to
  resolve when during one merge window two new boards showed up which both
  added i2cN_pin_x with different content.
- When a new board needs the same pins but with different drive strength
  settings a new group was required
- With SD/MMC we had groups for 4bit data, groups adding the remaining
  pins for 8bit data
- With UARTs we had groups for RX/TX and additionally groups adding
  RTS/CTS
- For graphics we had groups for 16bit data and 24bit data
- There is no way to remove the unused nodes from the binary dtb, so
  every board contained all existing pingroups for every other board,
  so the dtbs became quite big

So with only a few existing boards with very similar pinmux groups
it may work fine to put the groups into the SoC dtsi, but this way
may also explode quite fast with more and different boards.
I don't know how much variation there will be with Mediatek boards, so
I'm fine with either way. You may want to look at:

5a2a7d5 ARM: dts: imx51: make pinctrl nodes board specific
7ac0f70 ARM: dts: imx53: make pinctrl nodes board specific
817c27a ARM: dts: imx6qdl: make pinctrl nodes board specific
