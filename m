We need to consider the scenario where there are other users running
this code than you, and as Stephan suggest, they probably expect the
system to recover (by some means). Few people would be expected to pull
out their JTAG hardware and start hacking away...

That's certainly something we need to take into account, but does the
use of "may be" leave room for the possibility that we have a
recoverable error?

Also remember that the user might be in the middle of an important video
conference when the CDSP hits this error, so we don't necessarily want
to reboot the system just because we enter such state - there's user
policy involved here.
