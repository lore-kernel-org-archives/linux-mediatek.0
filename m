Hi everyone,

This is v10 of my "of: Introduce hardware prober driver" series.
v10 includes some minor changes pointed out by Andy and Doug. Everything
is fully reviewed and ready to be merged.

The older changelog entries have been moved to the bottom of the cover
letter.

Changes since v9:
- Picked up review-bys
- Added inclusion of stddef.h for NULL
- Added "noautosel" stable tag to the device tree patch

For the I2C component (touchscreens and trackpads) case from the
original series, the hardware prober driver finds the particular
class of device in the device tree, gets its parent I2C adapter,
and tries to initiate a simple I2C read for each device under that
I2C bus. When it finds one that responds, it considers that one
present, marks it as "okay", and returns, letting the driver core
actually probe the device.

This works fine in most cases since these components are connected
via a ribbon cable and always have the same resources. The prober
will also grab these resources and enable them.

The other case, selecting a display panel to use based on the SKU ID
from the firmware, hit a bit of an issue with fixing the OF graph.
It has been left out since v3.

Patch 1 adds of_changeset_update_prop_string(), as requested by Rob.

Patch 2 adds for_each_child_of_node_with_prefix(), as suggested by Andy.

Patch 3 implements probing the I2C bus for presence of components as
a hookable helper function in the I2C core.

Patch 4 implements regulator supply support as a set of simple helpers
for the I2C component prober.

Patch 5 implements GPIO support for the I2C component prober simple
helpers.

Patch 6 adds a ChromeOS specific DT hardware prober. This initial
version targets the Hana Chromebooks, probing its I2C trackpads and
touchscreens.

Patch 7 modifies the Hana device tree and marks the touchscreens
and trackpads as "fail-needs-probe", ready for the driver to probe.


The regulator parts were merged separately with an immutable tag [1]. Rob
already gave his Reviewed-by for the OF bits, and I assume he is OK with
them going through a different branch. So I believe it is fine for
Wolfram to take all the patch except the last one through the I2C tree.
The last DTS patch can be merged through the MediaTek tree once the
driver bits land.


Thanks
ChenYu
