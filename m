Hi, Sudeep,

ARM ARM said the counter should be in always-on domain, but
unfortunately that not true for mt8173. The last CPU enter idle can
choose to enter deep idle mode and the counter value would be lost. Our
firmware backup/recover the counter so it looks like it is stopped.
That's why I thought we need to use it as sched clocksource.

On mt8173, we will fix the firmware to add missing counts, so it will
looks like the counter keep counting. But other mediatek platform have
similar issue, and the 2 counter have same resolution, so I still want
to keep using GPT as sched clocksource.
