There are 2 versions of the SoC. MT7623N is almost identical to MT7623A
but has some additional multimedia features. The reference boards are
available as NAND or MMC and might have a different ethernet setup. In
order to reduce the duplication of devicetree code we add an intermediate
dtsi file for these reference boards. Additionally MTK/WCN pointed out,
that the EVB is yet another board and the board in question is infact the
RFB. Take this into account while renaming the files.
