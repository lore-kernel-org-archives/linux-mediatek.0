I want to verify with MediaTek whether the Genio 700 EVK can make use of the
dual-core SCP first, as it is highly possible that it indeed can and, if that
is the case, counting that any product development would be anyway based on
the EVK.... we will probably never see single-core SCP in MT8188 devicetrees
ever again.

Please send the Geralt/Ciri devicetrees without SCP support for now, so that
we can get the vast majority of the code upstream - which anyway is likely
95% of what you have right now... then I will either notify you for how to
proceed with the SCP (especially if I come to a conclusion before you send
the new series), or I will just send the SCP DT series on my own.

Cheers,
Angelo
