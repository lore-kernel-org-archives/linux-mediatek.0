You and me both. :) And yes, one of the intended results is to make the
clk driver probe faster.

This series itself already touches a lot of code, even if most of it was
done by coccinelle. I'd like to send them separately to not overwhelm
people.

Also, I haven't actually started on that part yet. It is actually part 3
of my overall plan. I have a good idea of what to do, given I did similar
work for the sunxi-ng clk drivers (though half finished...).

Most of the clk references are internal to each driver, and those would
be mapped from some CLK_ID to some `struct clk_hw *` internally, but all
blocks have external parents that need to be modeled as well, and we
would likely need global clk name fallbacks for the blocks that don't
have parents declared in the device tree, which is unfortunately most
of them. Especially the central clock controllers like infracfg or pericfg
take many clk inputs, to the point that MediaTek folks were somewhat
unwilling to bloat the device tree with them.

So it does seem easier to use something like clk_parent_data with
`struct clk_hw *` replaced with an index everywhere. This structure
would get converted into clk_parent_data by the singular clk registration
helpers.

This would have to coexist with the existing helpers we have. So I think
this work would be combined with the helper API cleanup / alignment with
clk provider API.

Does that make sense to you?

I'm working with MT8183 right now, as it can readily boot mainline to a
shell. Depending on the schedule and whose on board with resources, I'd
probably handle the other ChromeOS platforms, or delegate it internally.
