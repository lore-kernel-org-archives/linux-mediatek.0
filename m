Ok, let's just go with 1_2_444 then - makes sense... that's something
that must be accounted at the API level, because I know of some panels
that need the PRE_SCR set... and that's even if they're using v1.2, just
because - for whatever reason - some of the DSC params are stored in and
read from an OTP area of the DriverIC (and that would mismatch then with
the other params that are runtime-programmable from the DrIC view, which
results in pixel-garbage artifacts).

Not sure how many panels are doing that, but this is of course not a MTK
specific thing... I looked around, and apparently there's a mention of
that in the Intel driver as well - yay I'm not the only one who knows, lol.

(And I definitely didn't expect that to be the case anyway).

Honestly, since it works right now, I would be happier to push this upstream
as-is, and then shuffle things around (for an optimization, or else) after
the fact.

The point is to have a working baseline upstream, then if needed improve it
later when further testing can be done - point is that there's a huge set
of patches that is restructuring everything, so I want to play safe as much
as I can in this moment - I think (and hope) you understand my feeling here.

That's... a w e s o m e !

This is a practical test of the restructured code on yet another platform,
and I'm happier now because it's a different type of device (as in, not a
laptop and not an aiot board).

Thanks for that, highly appreciated.

Cheers,
Angelo
