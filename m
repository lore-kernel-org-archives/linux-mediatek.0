If you literally get 0xffff_ffff_0000_0000 when reading the BAR, that
is out of spec because the low-order 4 bits of a 64-bit memory BAR
cannot all be zero.

A 64-bit BAR consumes two DWORDS in config space.  For a 64-bit BAR0,
the DWORD at 0x10 contains the low-order bits, and the DWORD at 0x14
contains the upper 32 bits.  Bits 0-3 of the low-order DWORD (the
one at 0x10) are read-only, and in this case should contain the value
0b1100 (0xc).  That means the range is prefetchable (bit 3 == 1) and
the BAR is 64 bits (bits 2:1 == 10).

Either (1) this is a hardware defect that feeds incorrect data to the
BAR size calculation, or (2) there's a problem in the BAR size
calculation code.  We need to figure out which one and work around or
fix it correctly.

It's totally fine to work around hardware defects, but we have to
clearly understand the problem so we do it correctly.  For example, we
probably can't just clear out the BAR0 resource in the pci_dev,
because the BAR in the hardware device still contains a value, and if
we enable memory decoding for the device, it will still respond to the
region described by the BAR.
