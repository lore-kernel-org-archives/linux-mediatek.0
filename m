I think it'd be better to check for an exact frequency: this is board
specific and its exact value is known.

For what it's worth sensors generally have xshutdown (or reset) pin that is
active high. Looking at the code, it is not the case here. It's a bit odd
since the usual arrangement saves power when the camera is not in use; it's
not a lot but still. Oh well.

Not really needed; the driver does expect regulators, GPIOs etc., but by
leaving out of_match_ptr(), the driver will also probe on ACPI based
systems.
