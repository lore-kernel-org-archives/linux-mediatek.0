Yeah, I know how it is regarding firmware updates... but you know, I *must* try to
get OEMs/ODMs to do the right thing when hacky things get in front of me, and I am
fully aware that many of them largely underestimate such issues, and even close the
possibility to fix those, which is even worst.

On the other hand, I know you, and I know that you always try to do the same
whenever you can, so please, be aware that I'm not complaining about you.

Unfortunately, this is not just a ChromeOS problem but way larger...

Anyway, I'll stop here to prevent myself from going OT too much and being grumpier
than I already am :-P

I guess then just add the SPMI PMIC and add a big comment that clearly states
something like

/*
  * The mt6319_buck1 is the cpu-supply for CPU6 and CPU7.
  *
  * However, this device ships with a broken firmware which needs to be updated to
  * at version XXXXXXX or newer in order to workaround a bug that (describe bug).
  *
  * [blahblah text so that's why the cpu supply was not assigned to cpu6/7].
  */

...so that everyone reading the DT is fully aware of what's going on and can act
accordingly if they wish.

How does that sound?

Cheers,
Angelo
