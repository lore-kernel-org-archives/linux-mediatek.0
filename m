Wolfram,

I have second thought on these API now. Recently, we have saw similar
issue for spi device driver.

I believe the reason for these api is because some arch changed to can
not do DMA on stack recently. Maybe we should have dma_mapping to bounce
buffer like it bounce un-dma-able address for those arch? or we should
have a common driver API for this, not just for i2c?
