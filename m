Hi Thomas,

Thanks so much for very constructive comments.

Summary of below response,

1, Yes. System timer has a "clock enable (i.e., SYST_CON_EN)" design
which not only start timer to countdown but also be required to make
interrupt function work.

In other words, SYST_CON_EN shall be set before user changes interrupt
related registers, for example, enable or disable interrupt.

2. The driver certainly has to be optimized and redundant register
operations shall be removed.

Both things will be done in v6.

As above summary said, SYST_CON_EN shall be set to
1. Change interrupt function.
2. Allow timeout tick to be updated.

We will document those as comments in v6.

Will be fixed in v6.

Here full dance is not necessary and we only need to "clear and disable
interrupt".

Will be optimized in v6.

Timer reset here is not necessary.

Will be removed in v6.

As above response in mtk_syst_reset().

Yes, we have reviewed reset timing and found most of them are not
necessary actually.

We will optimize driver in v6.
