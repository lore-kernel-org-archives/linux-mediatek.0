Ah ok. But if you have 2 blocks that make up the overall drm device, why
don't you need to switch at runtime between them? I.e. buffer allocated
for crtc0 needs to be dma-mapped to crtc0, buffer allocated to crtc1 needs
to be dma-mapped on crtc1?

And if they're both the exact same iommu, then imo it would make indeed
sense to move the iommu attribute up. Since your current code cant'
actually handle truly separate dma-mappings. And neither can your patch
series here handled separate iommu for crtc0 and crtc1.

I meant to say that mediatek should use drm_gem_prime_import_dev, but
currently isn't using that. And your patch series here doesn't fix that
either. So there's more bugs left in this area.

This isn't how upstream works :-)

Yup, that's my suggestion. Then we can look at what mtk can use unchanged
from the core helpers. And what would need to change and so better
evaluate whether it makes sense to do that.

I still think just moving the iommu is probably best.
