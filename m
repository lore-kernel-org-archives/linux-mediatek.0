Thank you for stating the obvious. I never claimed it was.

Situation before phylink_pcs conversion:
- code paths that configure the PCS are integrated with the rest of the
  driver and would be called where appropriate.

Situation after phylink_pcs conversion:
- code paths that configure the PCS are no longer integrated with the
  rest of the driver and are now dependent on phylink being used for
  them to be called.

If there is no problem with doing this conversion, then why has the
proposed conversion of mv88e6xxx caused breakage when it was working
fine previously - it's because of exactly the above.

Are you going to do that conversion then? Good luck trying to find all
the drivers, sending out series of patches, trying to get people to test
the changes.

I don't have evidence that existing drivers have broken because I don't
have the hardware to test. I only have Marvell DSA switch hardware and
that is it.

Everything else has to be based on theory because no one bothers to
respond to my patches, so for 99% of the DSA drivers I'm working in the
dark - and that makes development an utter shitpile of poo in hell.

As I've said many times, we have NO CLUE which DSA drivers make use of
this defaulting behaviour - the only one I'm aware of that does is
mv88e6xxx. It all depends on the firmware description, driver behaviour
and hardware behaviour. There is not enough information in the kernel 
to be able to derive this.

If there was a reported regression, then I would be looking to get this
into the NET tree not the NET-NEXT tree.
