Ok, in this case, perhaps we should treat the GCE like an IOMMU, and
have its binding define 32 slots or channels.
Then, any device that wishes to send the GCE commands for its address
range should register a phandle to the gce, including the
corresponding slot.

For example:

include/.../gce.h
include/dt-bindings/../mediatek-gce.h
#define GCE_SLOT_1  1
...

arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt8173.dtsi:

&ovl0: {
  mediatek,gce = <&gce GCE_SLOT_1>;
};

&ovl1: {
  mediatek,gce = <&gce GCE_SLOT_1>;
};

&rdma2: {
  mediatek,gce = <&gce GCE_SLOT_2>;
};

&mutex: {
  mediatek,gce = <&gce GCE_SLOT_3>;
};

&od: {
  mediatek,gce = <&gce GCE_SLOT_3>;
};

Then, as each platform driver is probed, it can use the phandle to
look up its corresponding gce slot instance, retrieving an (opaque)
pointer to a struct gce_slot.
The gce driver can have a set of constant tables matching the slots to
address ranges for particular per-soc compatibles, one of which is
loaded on probe.
Later, when the device (gce consumer) wants to send a gce write
command, it passes in the gce_slot as an argument, and the gce driver
can do the corresponding lookup of subsys value and mask out the
provided *device virtual* address.  In this way, you also no longer
need to convert the devices iomap'ed addresses into physical addresses
before passing them to the gce.

WDYT?
