Yeah, I found out about the pmdomain set_performance_state callback
a few days ago. I've not looked into it much so far because not
unlike a veterinarian on a cattle ranch, I was elbow-deep in v3's
guts already and didn't want to pivot to something different before
pushing it out, but I'll look into it more seriously now.

Even if it means I have to get rid of my fun array binary search
and rely on the opp core to do its linear time linked list
traversal. :'( (But moving OPP core to use XArrays instead is a
concern for the future.)

I've also been avoiding it because I didn't know how much
additional functionality we'll add later, but I've talked with
Angelo about it an hour ago and he agrees that I should go down
the pmdomain route for the current functionality.

Thank you for the hints!

Kind regards,
Nicolas Frattaroli
