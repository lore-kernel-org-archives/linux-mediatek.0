addr contains a DMA address, not a physical address. Could we call it
scp_mem_dma instead?

addr is a DMA address, so phys_to_page() can't be called on it. The
simplest thing here would be to use dma_map_single() with ptr as the
CPU address expected.

We also need to free the allocated memory.

As per above, we don't have access to the struct page we want to map.
We probably want to get the CPU VA using vb2_plane_vaddr() and call
dma_map_single() instead.

I think DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING is good to have for all the buffers
that don't need to be accessed from the kernel anyway, to avoid
unnecessary kernel mapping operations. However, for coherent memory
pool, it doesn't change anything, because the memory always has a
kernel mapping. We also need the kernel virtual address for
dma_map_single(). Also the flag doesn't eliminate the need to do the
sync, e.g. if the userspace accesses the buffer.

Could you give me more information about the failure you're seeing?
Where is the dma_sync_sg_for_device() called from? Where do you get
the sgtable from?

Best regards,
Tomasz
