Same answer as before more or less. There is a lot of card specific
initialization happening in soc_probe_component(). The card field is
initialized to the card the component is bound to, the DAPM widgets are
created for the component in the cards DAPM graph, DAI link widgets are
created and so on. If you bind the component to multiple cards the
initialization will only be done for one card, the first one it was bound
to, that doesn't make too much sense. If you look at the snd_soc_component
data structure it should be obvious that it does not make sense to associate
it with more than a single card.

It was never intended that it is possible to bind a component to multiple
cards. That it was possible was a bug that was overlooked and some people
tried to do it which caused apparently random crashes later on, caused by
the data structure corruption. This is why we added the check to catch this
kind of mistake early and to avoid the crashes.
