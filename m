In general, we don't have two very similar drivers. We try to have one
driver. If the problem was just missing features in the stmmac driver,
you can add them. I doubt not supporting 2.5/4/5Gbps in your silicon
is an issue, since very few STMMAC devices have this. By split header,
do you mean support for TSO? That seems to be a gmac4 or newer
feature, but the driver supports not having tso support in hardware.

Giuseppe, Alexandre, Jose: Please can you look at the proposed driver
and see how much it really differs from the STMMAC driver. How easy
would it be to extend stmmac it to support the mt2712?

Thanks
