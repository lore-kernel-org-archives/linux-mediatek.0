Hi Mark,

Thanks for your review and patiently explain your thought to us.

In the case of svs[1], which Henry mentioned in cover letter, it can be
regarded as a special consumer who requires very accurate voltage for
calibration the hardware in its initialization stage. So, this kinds of
consumers know their regulator very well and only need to switch to the
modes they want in the particular conditions.
However, IIUC, you want a proposal to provide a sort of QoS framework
which can cover most of use cases who care about the regular quality in
runtime, is that correct?

IMHO, some quality index can be considered, for example:
Minimum Current Requirement (mA): If a user specified this constraint in
runtime, it means that he cares more about the supplying quality like
transient voltage drop, ripple above certain load.
Maximum Current Requirement (mA): If a user specified this constraint in
runtime, it means that he cares more about the power consumption under
certain load.
It could be a flexible way instead to tie the operation modes directly.

BTW, we should encourage people here to share more use cases related to
regulator quality issues, especially in runtime, so we can evaluate the
most suitable index to fit the requirements.

What do you think?
