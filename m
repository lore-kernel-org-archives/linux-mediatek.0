I can understand your concern here. I do have plans to add more drivers
in the future for this board but I can't give you any roadmap for that
since it mostly falls under the spare time work and I have been doing a
similar kind of work for the Bubblegum-96 board in parallel.

At most I can guarentee that this board's functionality will be added
gradually in upcoming days.

Thanks,
Mani
