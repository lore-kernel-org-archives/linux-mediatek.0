Please note that ALSA (both the kernel and the userspace API) requires
that after a period interrupt, the _complete_ period has been read from/
written to the memory buffer.  This is needed because the interrupt is
the mechanism that synchronizes software and the DMA controller.
(Except when using the NO_PERIOD_WAKUP flag, but you cannot rely on the
software using it.)


Typically, any buffering is done inside the DMA controller, which also
issues interrupts, so this problem should not happen with correctly
working hardware.

(On PCI systems, writes to system memory can be buffered, but if the
interrupt handler does a read from a device register, the PCI memory
ordering rules ensure that all DMA accesses started before the interrupt
are finished before the read.)


How does your hardware work?  I guess that whatever component does the
buffering is independent of the component that generates interrupts, and
it does not enforce any memory ordering either?  And there isn't
a mechanism to flush the buffer?
