Apart from the question of what type should be used, what do you think
about this part?  I don't think we should assume that the address on
PCI is identical to the CPU physical address.  IOMMUs and (I assume)
iATUs can make them different, can't they?  If so, this looks like an
implicit assumption that PCI bus==CPU physical, and I think we should
make that a little more explicit somehow.

Doesn't .irq_compose_msi_msg() build the Message Address/Data pair
that is programmed into a device's MSI Capability or MSI-X Table?
The device will eventually use that to initiate a DMA write to that
address.

In that sense, I would argue that the Message Address does belong to
the DMA domain.  I don't think the size of the address (32 vs 64 bits)
is determined by the CPU physical address size (phys_addr_t); it's
determined by the size of DMA addresses.
