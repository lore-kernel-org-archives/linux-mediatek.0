As I understand the 4.4.8 section it just means the device can't assume a fixed
time interval between transfers, meaning that the host can use the last microframe
in one esit and the first microframe in the next esit, but still only use 1 microframe
per esit.

Section 8.12.6.1 describes how a 11 packet isoc transfer is allowed to be split
to 1 burst of 11 packets, 2 burst (8 + 3),  3 burst (4+4+3) 6 bursts (2+2+2+2+2+1) or
11 bursts of 1. These are however all within the same microframe. Splitting the
transfer into several microframes in a esit kind of makes the whole interval concept pointless.
